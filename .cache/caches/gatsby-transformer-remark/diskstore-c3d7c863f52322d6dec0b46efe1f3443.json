It lets you build server-side rendering and static web applications using React. It's a great tool to build your next website. It has many great features and advantages, which can make Nextjs your first option for building your next web application.</p>\n<p>You don't need any configuration of webpack or similar to start using Next.js. It comes with its configuration. All you need is to run <code>npm run dev</code> and start building your application ?.</p>\n<p>In this article, we are going to explore the great features and tricks of Next.js, and how to start building your next website with it.</p>\n<p><strong>This post assumes that you have some basic knowledge of React and JavaScript.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some great websites built with Next.js:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://syntax.fm/\">Syntaxt.fm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npmjs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://material-ui.com/\">material-ui.io</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://expo.io/\">expo.io</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codementor.io/\">codemenitor.io</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I even used Nextjs to build my personal website <a href=\"https://www.saidhayani.me/\">saidhayani.me</a> — you can get the source code on GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/hayanisaid/said-hayani-nextjs\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Getting starting with Next.js</h3>\n<p>To start with Next.js you need to have node.js installed in your machine and that's all. Next.js is like any other node.js application — you need npm or Yarn to install dependencies.</p>\n<p>Let's get started and create a Next.js project.</p>\n<p>First, we need to create a folder and give it a name of our choice. I'm gonna name it <code>nextjs-app</code>.</p>\n<p>You can easily do that with this command line:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*k8DzCXqZwRaY64Bhli5-yQ.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>mkdir nextjs-app\n</code></pre>\n<p>After creating the nextjs-app folder, open it on the terminal. Run <code>npm init</code> to create the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>\n<p>Next, we have to install our dependencies.</p>\n<p>Installing Next.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>using Yarn, type</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>yarn add next\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>using npm, type:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>npm i next --save\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then we have to install React because Next.js uses React. The first line below uses Yarn for the installation.</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add react react-dom\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>// with npm\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>npm i react react-dom --save\n</code></pre>\n<p>After that you have to create two necessary folders: <code>pages</code> and <code>static</code> . Next.js won't work without them!!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*s3N5eZcSSSgRdBiaMQeCRA.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>mkdir pages static\n</code></pre>\n<p>You <strong>must</strong> have this structure after running these commands :</p>\n<pre><code>nextjs-app  -pages  -static  -package.json\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then simply you can run <code>npm next dev</code> and then open <code>[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)</code> in your browser.</p>\n<p>The <code>NotFound</code> page will show up because we don't have any page yet!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*Hv_4BaqTnrlriZ8Q3zk5ZQ.png\"></p>\n<p>So let's create a <code>home</code> page and an entry point <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*IwZ5Ahr9egJ8KHF5HnLfHQ.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>touch index.js home.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then you can write a normal React component. As I said above, Next.js is for building React applications.</p>\n<p>Here is what our <code>home.js</code> looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*He5fQw-VgeY5Gjo2RFGckw.png\"></p>\n<p>And here is our <code>index.js</code> file:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*AgGKp-WdRTwb3bOuqljcug.png\"></p>\n<p>Next.js has a live reload feature. All you need to do is just change and save, and Next.js will compile and reload the app automatically for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Next.js is like any other server-side rendering tool we need to define the default page of our application, in our case is <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n<p>You will see this change in the browser after running <code>npm next dev</code>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*QuQK1J5P0Rc4S-0BhllNmg.png\"></p>\n<p>Congratulations! We just created a Next.js app with a few simple steps. These instructions to create a Next.js app are described in the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started/first-page\">official docs of Next.js</a> .</p>\n<h4>My alternative</h4>\n<p>I usually don't use this way. I use the <a href=\"http://import%20react%20from/\">create-next-app</a> CLI instead that will do all this stuff for me in one single line.</p>\n<pre><code>npx create-next-app my-app\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*W5KCIFWP7yMHI-zaeVcmPA.png\"></p>\n<p>You can check out the documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app\">here</a> to explore more features.</p>\n<h3>Create custom configs for Next.js</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you might want to add some additional dependencies or packages to your Next.js app.</p>\n<p>Next.js gives you the option to customize your configuration using a <code>next-config.js</code> file.</p>\n<p>For example, you might want to add sass support to your app. In this case you have to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-sass\">next-sass</a> package <strong>and</strong> you have to add it to the <code>next-config.js</code> file as in the example below:</p>\n<p>First, install <code>next-sass</code>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*5XSEx8DH0851FNzMxDx5LQ.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>yarn add @zeit/next-sass\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then include it inside the <code>next-config.js</code> file:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*YN_aoR5dzlnMyG2xVHJcww.png\"></p>\n<p>And then you can create write your sass code and import it in your component:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*kde4wjR-EpoNHc1c4JTb8g.png\"></p>\n<p>Importing the sass file in our component:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*yv1cTBXPeONqaV-CS1OZ2A.png\"></p>\n<p>And here is the result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*VYfSkK1fIZKu75-2P8s4Bw.png\"></p>\n<p>Wow, wasn't that <strong>super easy</strong> to add sass support to out Next.js app?</p>\n<p>At this point, we just covered the installation and configuration part. Now let's talk about the features of Next.js!</p>\n<h3>The features</h3>\n<p>Next.js comes with a bunch of great features like server-side rendering, routers, and lazy loading.</p>\n<h4>Server-side rendering</h4>\n<p>Next.js performs server-side rendering by default. This makes your application optimized for search engines. Also, you can integrate any middleware such as <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">express.js</a> or <a href=\"https://hapijs.com/\">Hapi.js</a>, and you can run any database such as MongoDB or MySQL.</p>\n<p>Speaking of search engine optimization, Next.js comes with a <code>Head</code> component that allows you to add and make dynamic meta tags. It's my favorite feature — you can make custom and dynamic meta tags. These make your website able to be indexed by search engines like Google. Here is an example of a <code>Head</code> component :</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*mnIJGBgF59r1YjX5jXu8IA.png\"></p>\n<p>And you can import and use the<code>Head</code> component in any other page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*liF5bNPAQ_j7gA9funSGTg.png\"></p>\n<p>Awesome!</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: With Next.js you <strong>don't</strong> need to import React because Next.js does this for you.</p>\n<h4>Generating a static website with Next.js</h4>\n<p>As well as server-side rendering, you still can compile and export your application as an HTML static website and deploy it on a static website hosting like a GitHub page or <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">netlify</a>. You can learn more how to make a static website with Next.js <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/static-html-export/setup\">here in the official docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Routers</h4>\n<p>This is another one of the great features of Next.js. When you use the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app\">create-react-app</a>, you usually need to install <a href=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\">react-router</a> and create its custom configuration.</p>\n<p>Next.js comes with its own routers with zero configs. You don't need any extra configuration of your routers. Just create your page inside the <code>pages</code> folder and Next.js will take care of all routing configuration.</p>\n<p>Let's go ahead and create a custom navigation to make everything clear!</p>\n<p>To navigate between pages, Next.js has the <code>Link</code> method to manage the navigation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*D54h6wnKX9fCS0AU34tVLA.png\"></p>\n<p>Let's create <code>blog.js</code> and <code>contact.js</code> pages:</p>\n<p><code>blog.js</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*f6_vaaPs1Okfj8vZ9Fhk8g.png\"></p>\n<p>And here is the <code>contact.js</code> page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*5lWCDzAUWed2NlsGpTC5EQ.png\"></p>\n<p>And now we must be able to navigate between those pages ?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*7WYZeRb92PAwqthLo0xqHg.gif\"></p>\n<p>Wow that so easy and super awesome.</p>\n<h4>Lazy loading</h4>\n<p>Lazy loading makes your application deliver a better user experience. Sometimes the page might take time to load. The user may abandon your app if the loading takes more than 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>The way to avoid this is to use some trick to indicate to the user that the page is loading, for example by displaying a spinner. Lazy loading or code splitting is one of the features that allow you to deal with, and control, slow loading so you only load the necessary code in your page.</p>\n<p>Next.js comes with its own code splitting method. It provides us a method, called <code>dynamic</code>, to load our component, as in the example below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*Ib835M7Ih-RY1kRBOUnXFA.png\"></p>\n<p>You can find the source code of these examples on <a href=\"https://github.com/hayanisaid/nextjs-intro-example\">GitHub</a></p>"}
