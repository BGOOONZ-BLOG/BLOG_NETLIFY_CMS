A plugin that simplifies adding [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments to your [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) website  

## Description  
The goal of this plugin is to allow users to bring their content to life and cultivate engaged communities by integrating Disqus comments into their blazing-fast Gatsby websites. After struggling to integrate different Disqus components into my Gatsby site, creating an easily-configured plugin for the Gatsby ecosystem felt like a no-brainer.  

## Install  
```sh
$ yarn add gatsby-plugin-disqus
```  
or  
```sh
$ npm install -S gatsby-plugin-disqus
```

## Configure  

Add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js` file with your [Disqus shortname](https://help.disqus.com/installation/whats-a-shortname)  

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-disqus`,
      options: {
        shortname: `your-disqus-shortname`
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

## Usage  

You can use the plugin as shown in this brief example:  

```jsx
import { Disqus, CommentCount } from 'gatsby-plugin-disqus'

const PostTemplate = () => {
  let disqusConfig = {
    url: `${config.siteUrl+location.pathname}`,
    identifier: post.id,
    title: post.title,
  }
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <CommentCount config={disqusConfig} placeholder={'...'} />
      /* Post Contents */
      <Disqus config={disqusConfig} />
    </>
  )
}

export default PostTemplate
```

While providing a `url`, `identifier`, and `title` are optional, these attributes are recommended as it will prevent threads from being lost in the case that the domain changes or the post is renamed.
Additional information on all available parameters can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/tterb/gatsby-plugin-disqus/wiki/Configure#parameters).

**Note:** When running your site locally, you should pass the production URL to the `config.url` because this is the URL that Disqus will associate with the `shortname` and `identifier` to identify the correct comment thread.
