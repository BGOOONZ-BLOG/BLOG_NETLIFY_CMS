In browsers, JavaScript shares a thread with a load of other stuff that differs from browser to browser. But typically JavaScript is in the same queue as painting, updating styles, and handling user actions (such as highlighting text and interacting with form controls). Activity in one of these things delays the others.</p>\n<p>As a human being, you're multithreaded. You can type with multiple fingers, you can drive and hold a conversation at the same time. The only blocking function we have to deal with is sneezing, where all current activity must be suspended for the duration of the sneeze. That's pretty annoying, especially when you're driving and trying to hold a conversation. You don't want to write code that's sneezy.</p>\n<p>You've probably used events and callbacks to get around this. Here are events:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');\nimg1.addEventListener('load', function () {\n    // woo yey image loaded\n});\nimg1.addEventListener('error', function () {\n    // argh everything's broken\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This isn't sneezy at all. We get the image, add a couple of listeners, then JavaScript can stop executing until one of those listeners is called.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the example above, it's possible that the events happened before we started listening for them, so we need to work around that using the \"complete\" property of images:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');\nfunction loaded() {\n// woo yey image loaded}if (img1.complete) {\nloaded();\n}else {\nimg1.addEventListener('load', loaded);\n}img1.addEventListener('error', function() {\n// argh everything's broken\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This doesn't catch images that errored before we got a chance to listen for them; unfortunately the DOM doesn't give us a way to do that. Also, this is loading one image. Things get even more complex if we want to know when a set of images have loaded.</p>\n<h2>Events aren't always the best way <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#events-aren&#x27;t-always-the-best-way\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Events are great for things that can happen multiple times on the same object---<code>keyup</code>, <code>touchstart</code> etc. With those events you don't really care about what happened before you attached the listener. But when it comes to async success/failure, ideally you want something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">img1.callThisIfLoadedOrWhenLoaded(function() {\n// loaded}).orIfFailedCallThis(function() {\n// failed\n});\n// and...whenAllTheseHaveLoaded([img1, img2]).callThis(function() {\n// all loaded}).orIfSomeFailedCallThis(function() {\n// one or more failed\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is what promises do, but with better naming. If HTML image elements had a \"ready\" method that returned a promise, we could do this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">img1.ready().then(function() {\n// loaded}, function() {\n// failed\n});\n// and...Promise.all([img1.ready(), img2.ready()]).then(function() {\n// all loaded}, function() {\n// one or more failed\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>At their most basic, promises are a bit like event listeners except:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A promise can only succeed or fail once. It cannot succeed or fail twice, neither can it switch from success to failure or vice versa.</li>\n<li>If a promise has succeeded or failed and you later add a success/failure callback, the correct callback will be called, even though the event took place earlier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is extremely useful for async success/failure, because you're less interested in the exact time something became available, and more interested in reacting to the outcome.</p>\n<h2>Promise terminology <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#promise-terminology\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/domenic\">Domenic Denicola</a> proof read the first draft of this article and graded me \"F\" for terminology. He put me in detention, forced me to copy out <a href=\"https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping/blob/master/docs/states-and-fates.md\">States and Fates</a> 100 times, and wrote a worried letter to my parents. Despite that, I still get a lot of the terminology mixed up, but here are the basics:</p>\n<p>A promise can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fulfilled - The action relating to the promise succeeded</li>\n<li>rejected - The action relating to the promise failed</li>\n<li>pending - Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet</li>\n<li>settled - Has fulfilled or rejected</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-promise-objects\">The spec</a> also uses the term thenable to describe an object that is promise-like, in that it has a <code>then</code> method. This term reminds me of ex-England Football Manager <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Venables\">Terry Venables</a> so I'll be using it as little as possible.</p>\n<h2>Promises arrive in JavaScript! <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#promises-arrive-in-javascript!\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Promises have been around for a while in the form of libraries, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kriskowal/q\">Q</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cujojs/when\">when</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211867.aspx\">WinJS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js\">RSVP.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above and JavaScript promises share a common, standardized behaviour called <a href=\"https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec\">Promises/A+</a>. If you're a jQuery user, they have something similar called <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/\">Deferreds</a>. However, Deferreds aren't Promise/A+ compliant, which makes them <a href=\"https://thewayofcode.wordpress.com/tag/jquery-deferred-broken/\">subtly different and less useful</a>, so beware. jQuery also has <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/Types/#Promise\">a Promise type</a>, but this is just a subset of Deferred and has the same issues.</p>\n<p>Although promise implementations follow a standardized behaviour, their overall APIs differ. JavaScript promises are similar in API to RSVP.js. Here's how you create a promise:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n// do a thing, possibly async, then...  if (/* everything turned out fine */) {\n  resolve(\"Stuff worked!\");\n  }  else {\n  reject(Error(\"It broke\"));\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>The promise constructor takes one argument, a callback with two parameters, resolve and reject. Do something within the callback, perhaps async, then call resolve if everything worked, otherwise call reject.</p>\n<p>Like <code>throw</code> in plain old JavaScript, it's customary, but not required, to reject with an Error object. The benefit of Error objects is they capture a stack trace, making debugging tools more helpful.</p>\n<p>Here's how you use that promise:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">promise.then(function (result) {\n    console.log(result);\n    // \"Stuff worked!\"}, function(err) {\n    console.log(err);\n    // Error: \"It broke\"\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>then()</code> takes two arguments, a callback for a success case, and another for the failure case. Both are optional, so you can add a callback for the success or failure case only.</p>\n<p>JavaScript promises started out in the DOM as \"Futures\", renamed to \"Promises\", and finally moved into JavaScript. Having them in JavaScript rather than the DOM is great because they'll be available in non-browser JS contexts such as Node.js (whether they make use of them in their core APIs is another question).</p>\n<p>Although they're a JavaScript feature, the DOM isn't afraid to use them. In fact, all new DOM APIs with async success/failure methods will use promises. This is happening already with <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/quota/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#idl-def-StorageQuota\">Quota Management</a>, <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-font-loading/#font-face-set-ready\">Font Load Events</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/blob/cf459d473ae09f6994e8539113d277cbd2bce939/service_worker.ts#L17\">ServiceWorker</a>, <a href=\"https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#widl-Navigator-requestMIDIAccess-Promise-MIDIOptions-options\">Web MIDI</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/whatwg/streams#basereadablestream\">Streams</a>, and more.</p>\n<h2>Browser support &#x26; polyfill <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#browser-support-and-polyfill\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are already implementations of promises in browsers today.</p>\n<p>As of Chrome 32, Opera 19, Firefox 29, Safari 8 &#x26; Microsoft Edge, promises are enabled by default.</p>\n<p>To bring browsers that lack a complete promises implementation up to spec compliance, or add promises to other browsers and Node.js, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/jakearchibald/ES6-Promises#readme\">the polyfill</a> (2k gzipped).</p>\n<h2>Compatibility with other libraries <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#compatibility-with-other-libraries\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The JavaScript promises API will treat anything with a <code>then()</code> method as promise-like (or <code>thenable</code> in promise-speak <em>sigh</em>), so if you use a library that returns a Q promise, that's fine, it'll play nice with the new JavaScript promises.</p>\n<p>Although, as I mentioned, jQuery's Deferreds are a bit ... unhelpful. Thankfully you can cast them to standard promises, which is worth doing as soon as possible:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var jsPromise = Promise.resolve($.ajax('/whatever.json'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, jQuery's <code>$.ajax</code> returns a Deferred. Since it has a <code>then()</code> method, <code>Promise.resolve()</code> can turn it into a JavaScript promise. However, sometimes deferreds pass multiple arguments to their callbacks, for example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var jqDeferred = $.ajax('/whatever.json');\njqDeferred.then(function(response, statusText, xhrObj) {\n// ...}, function(xhrObj, textStatus, err) {\n// ...})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Whereas JS promises ignore all but the first:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">jsPromise.then(function(response) {\n// ...}, function(xhrObj) {\n// ...})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thankfully this is usually what you want, or at least gives you access to what you want. Also, be aware that jQuery doesn't follow the convention of passing Error objects into rejections.</p>\n<h2>Complex async code made easier <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#complex-async-code-made-easier\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Right, let's code some things. Say we want to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start a spinner to indicate loading</li>\n<li>Fetch some JSON for a story, which gives us the title, and urls for each chapter</li>\n<li>Add title to the page</li>\n<li>Fetch each chapter</li>\n<li>Add the story to the page</li>\n<li>Stop the spinner</li>\n</ol>\n<p>... but also tell the user if something went wrong along the way. We'll want to stop the spinner at that point too, else it'll keep on spinning, get dizzy, and crash into some other UI.</p>\n<p>Of course, you wouldn't use JavaScript to deliver a story, <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2013/progressive-enhancement-is-faster/\">serving as HTML is faster</a>, but this pattern is pretty common when dealing with APIs: Multiple data fetches, then do something when it's all done.</p>\n<p>To start with, let's deal with fetching data from the network:</p>\n<h2>Promisifying XMLHttpRequest <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#promisifying-xmlhttprequest\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Old APIs will be updated to use promises, if it's possible in a backwards compatible way. <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is a prime candidate, but in the mean time let's write a simple function to make a GET request:</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function get(url) {\n    // Return a new promise.\n    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n        // Do the usual XHR stuff\n        var req = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n        req.open('GET', url);\n\n        req.onload = function () {\n            // This is called even on 404 etc\n            // so check the status\n            if (req.status == 200) {\n                // Resolve the promise with the response text\n                resolve(req.response);\n            } else {\n                // Otherwise reject with the status text\n                // which will hopefully be a meaningful error\n                reject(Error(req.statusText));\n            }\n        };\n\n        // Handle network errors\n        req.onerror = function () {\n            reject(Error('Network Error'));\n        };\n\n        // Make the request\n        req.send();\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let's use it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">get('story.json').then(\n    function (response) {\n        console.log('Success!', response);\n    },\n    function (error) {\n        console.error('Failed!', error);\n    }\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can make HTTP requests without manually typing <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, which is great, because the less I have to see the infuriating camel-casing of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, the happier my life will be.</p>\n<h2>Chaining <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#chaining\">#</a></h2>\n<p><code>then()</code> isn't the end of the story, you can chain <code>then</code>s together to transform values or run additional async actions one after another.</p>\n<h3>Transforming values <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#transforming-values\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You can transform values simply by returning the new value:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n    resolve(1);\n});\n\npromise\n    .then(function (val) {\n        console.log(val);\n        // 1\n        return val + 2;\n    })\n    .then(function (val) {\n        console.log(val);\n        // 3\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a practical example, let's go back to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">get('story.json').then(function (response) {\n    console.log('Success!', response);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>The response is JSON, but we're currently receiving it as plain text. We could alter our get function to use the JSON <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#responseType\"><code>responseType</code></a>, but we could also solve it in promises land:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">get('story.json')\n    .then(function (response) {\n        return JSON.parse(response);\n    })\n    .then(function (response) {\n        console.log('Yey JSON!', response);\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since <code>JSON.parse()</code> takes a single argument and returns a transformed value, we can make a shortcut:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">get('story.json')\n    .then(JSON.parse)\n    .then(function (response) {\n        console.log('Yey JSON!', response);\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>In fact, we could make a <code>getJSON()</code> function really easily:</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function getJSON(url) {\n    return get(url).then(JSON.parse);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>getJSON()</code> still returns a promise, one that fetches a url then parses the response as JSON.</p>\n<h3>Queuing asynchronous actions <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#queuing-asynchronous-actions\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You can also chain <code>then</code>s to run async actions in sequence.</p>\n<p>When you return something from a <code>then()</code> callback, it's a bit magic. If you return a value, the next <code>then()</code> is called with that value. However, if you return something promise-like, the next <code>then()</code> waits on it, and is only called when that promise settles (succeeds/fails). For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">getJSON('story.json')\n    .then(function (story) {\n        return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[0]);\n    })\n    .then(function (chapter1) {\n        console.log('Got chapter 1!', chapter1);\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we make an async request to <code>story.json</code>, which gives us a set of URLs to request, then we request the first of those. This is when promises really start to stand out from simple callback patterns.</p>\n<p>You could even make a shortcut method to get chapters:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var storyPromise;\n\nfunction getChapter(i) {\n    storyPromise = storyPromise || getJSON('story.json');\n\n    return storyPromise.then(function (story) {\n        return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[i]);\n    });\n}\n\n// and using it is simple:\ngetChapter(0)\n    .then(function (chapter) {\n        console.log(chapter);\n\n        return getChapter(1);\n    })\n    .then(function (chapter) {\n        console.log(chapter);\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>We don't download <code>story.json</code> until <code>getChapter</code> is called, but the next time(s) <code>getChapter</code> is called we reuse the story promise, so <code>story.json</code> is only fetched once. Yay Promises!</p>\n<h2>Error handling <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#error-handling\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As we saw earlier, <code>then()</code> takes two arguments, one for success, one for failure (or fulfill and reject, in promises-speak):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">get('story.json').then(\n    function (response) {\n        console.log('Success!', response);\n    },\n    function (error) {\n        console.log('Failed!', error);\n    }\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also use <code>catch()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">get('story.json')\n    .then(function (response) {\n        console.log('Success!', response);\n    })\n    .catch(function (error) {\n        console.log('Failed!', error);\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>There's nothing special about <code>catch()</code>, it's just sugar for <code>then(undefined, func)</code>, but it's more readable. Note that the two code examples above do not behave the same, the latter is equivalent to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">get('story.json')\n    .then(function (response) {\n        console.log('Success!', response);\n    })\n    .then(undefined, function (error) {\n        console.log('Failed!', error);\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>The difference is subtle, but extremely useful. Promise rejections skip forward to the next <code>then()</code> with a rejection callback (or <code>catch()</code>, since it's equivalent). With <code>then(func1, func2)</code>, <code>func1</code> or <code>func2</code> will be called, never both. But with <code>then(func1).catch(func2)</code>, both will be called if <code>func1</code> rejects, as they're separate steps in the chain. Take the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">asyncThing1()\n    .then(function () {\n        return asyncThing2();\n    })\n    .then(function () {\n        return asyncThing3();\n    })\n    .catch(function (err) {\n        return asyncRecovery1();\n    })\n    .then(\n        function () {\n            return asyncThing4();\n        },\n        function (err) {\n            return asyncRecovery2();\n        }\n    )\n    .catch(function (err) {\n        console.log(\"Don't worry about it\");\n    })\n    .then(function () {\n        console.log('All done!');\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>The flow above is very similar to normal JavaScript try/catch, errors that happen within a \"try\" go immediately to the <code>catch()</code> block. Here's the above as a flowchart (because I love flowcharts):</p>\n<p>Follow the blue lines for promises that fulfill, or the red for ones that reject.</p>\n<h3>JavaScript exceptions and promises <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#javascript-exceptions-and-promises\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Rejections happen when a promise is explicitly rejected, but also implicitly if an error is thrown in the constructor callback:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var jsonPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n    // JSON.parse throws an error if you feed it some  // invalid JSON, so this implicitly rejects:  resolve(JSON.parse(\"This ain't JSON\"));\n});\njsonPromise\n    .then(function (data) {\n        // This never happens:  console.log(\"It worked!\", data);\n    })\n    .catch(function (err) {\n        // Instead, this happens:  console.log(\"It failed!\", err);\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>This means it's useful to do all your promise-related work inside the promise constructor callback, so errors are automatically caught and become rejections.</p>\n<p>The same goes for errors thrown in <code>then()</code> callbacks.</p>\n<pre><code>get('/').then(JSON.parse).then(function() {\n// This never happens, '/' is an HTML page, not JSON  // so JSON.parse throws  console.log(\"It worked!\", data);\n}).catch(function(err) {\n// Instead, this happens:  console.log(\"It failed!\", err);\n})\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Error handling in practice <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#error-handling-in-practice\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With our story and chapters, we can use catch to display an error to the user:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">getJSON('story.json')\n    .then(function (story) {\n        return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[0]);\n    })\n    .then(function (chapter1) {\n        addHtmlToPage(chapter1.html);\n    })\n    .catch(function () {\n        addTextToPage('Failed to show chapter');\n    })\n    .then(function () {\n        document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>If fetching <code>story.chapterUrls[0]</code> fails (e.g., http 500 or user is offline), it'll skip all following success callbacks, which includes the one in <code>getJSON()</code> which tries to parse the response as JSON, and also skips the callback that adds chapter1.html to the page. Instead it moves onto the catch callback. As a result, \"Failed to show chapter\" will be added to the page if any of the previous actions failed.</p>\n<p>Like JavaScript's try/catch, the error is caught and subsequent code continues, so the spinner is always hidden, which is what we want. The above becomes a non-blocking async version of:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">try {\n    var story = getJSONSync('story.json');\n    var chapter1 = getJSONSync(story.chapterUrls[0]);\n    addHtmlToPage(chapter1.html);\n} catch (e) {\n    addTextToPage('Failed to show chapter');\n}\ndocument.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';\n</code></pre>\n<p>You may want to <code>catch()</code> simply for logging purposes, without recovering from the error. To do this, just rethrow the error. We could do this in our <code>getJSON()</code> method:</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function getJSON(url) {\n    return get(url)\n        .then(JSON.parse)\n        .catch(function (err) {\n            console.log('getJSON failed for', url, err);\n            throw err;\n        });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we've managed to fetch one chapter, but we want them all. Let's make that happen.</p>\n<h2>Parallelism and sequencing: getting the best of both <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#parallelism-and-sequencing:-getting-the-best-of-both\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Thinking async isn't easy. If you're struggling to get off the mark, try writing the code as if it were synchronous. In this case:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">try {\n    var story = getJSONSync('story.json');\n    addHtmlToPage(story.heading);\n    story.chapterUrls.forEach(function (chapterUrl) {\n        var chapter = getJSONSync(chapterUrl);\n        addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);\n    });\n    addTextToPage('All done');\n} catch (err) {\n    addTextToPage('Argh, broken: ' + err.message);\n}\ndocument.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';\n</code></pre>\n<p>That works! But it's sync and locks up the browser while things download. To make this work async we use <code>then()</code> to make things happen one after another.</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {\naddHtmlToPage(story.heading);\n  // TODO: for each url in story.chapterUrls, fetch &#x26;amp; display}).then(function() {\n// And we're all done!  addTextToPage(\"All done\");\n}).catch(function(err) {\n// Catch any error that happened along the way  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);\n}).then(function() {\n// Always hide the spinner  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>But how can we loop through the chapter urls and fetch them in order? This doesn't work:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">story.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {\n// Fetch chapter  getJSON(chapterUrl).then(function(chapter) {\n  // and add it to the page    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);\n\n});\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>forEach</code> isn't async-aware, so our chapters would appear in whatever order they download, which is basically how Pulp Fiction was written. This isn't Pulp Fiction, so let's fix it.</p>\n<h3>Creating a sequence <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#creating-a-sequence\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We want to turn our <code>chapterUrls</code> array into a sequence of promises. We can do that using <code>then()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Start off with a promise that always resolvesvar sequence = Promise.resolve();\n// Loop through our chapter urlsstory.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {\n// Add these actions to the end of the sequence  sequence = sequence.then(function() {\n  return getJSON(chapterUrl);\n  }).then(function(chapter) {\n  addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);\n\n});\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the first time we've seen <code>Promise.resolve()</code>, which creates a promise that resolves to whatever value you give it. If you pass it an instance of <code>Promise</code> it'll simply return it (note: this is a change to the spec that some implementations don't yet follow). If you pass it something promise-like (has a <code>then()</code> method), it creates a genuine <code>Promise</code> that fulfills/rejects in the same way. If you pass in any other value, e.g., <code>Promise.resolve('Hello')</code>, it creates a promise that fulfills with that value. If you call it with no value, as above, it fulfills with \"undefined\".</p>\n<p>There's also <code>Promise.reject(val)</code>, which creates a promise that rejects with the value you give it (or undefined).</p>\n<p>We can tidy up the above code using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce\"><code>array.reduce</code></a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Loop through our chapter urlsstory.chapterUrls.reduce(function(sequence, chapterUrl) {\n// Add these actions to the end of the sequence  return sequence.then(function() {\n  return getJSON(chapterUrl);\n  }).then(function(chapter) {\n  addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);\n\n});\n}, Promise.resolve())\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is doing the same as the previous example, but doesn't need the separate \"sequence\" variable. Our reduce callback is called for each item in the array. \"sequence\" is <code>Promise.resolve()</code> the first time around, but for the rest of the calls \"sequence\" is whatever we returned from the previous call. <code>array.reduce</code> is really useful for boiling an array down to a single value, which in this case is a promise.</p>\n<p>Let's put it all together:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {\naddHtmlToPage(story.heading);\n  return story.chapterUrls.reduce(function(sequence, chapterUrl) {\n  // Once the last chapter's promise is done...    return sequence.then(function() {\n    // ...fetch the next chapter      return getJSON(chapterUrl);\n    }).then(function(chapter) {\n    // and add it to the page      addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);\n\n});\n  }, Promise.resolve());\n}).then(function() {\n// And we're all done!  addTextToPage(\"All done\");\n}).catch(function(err) {\n// Catch any error that happened along the way  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);\n}).then(function() {\n// Always hide the spinner  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>And there we have it, a fully async version of the sync version. But we can do better. At the moment our page is downloading like this:</p>\n<p>Browsers are pretty good at downloading multiple things at once, so we're losing performance by downloading chapters one after the other. What we want to do is download them all at the same time, then process them when they've all arrived. Thankfully there's an API for this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">Promise.all(arrayOfPromises).then(function(arrayOfResults) {\n//...})\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Promise.all</code> takes an array of promises and creates a promise that fulfills when all of them successfully complete. You get an array of results (whatever the promises fulfilled to) in the same order as the promises you passed in.</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {\naddHtmlToPage(story.heading);\n  // Take an array of promises and wait on them all  return Promise.all(    // Map our array of chapter urls to    // an array of chapter json promises    story.chapterUrls.map(getJSON)  );\n}).then(function(chapters) {\n// Now we have the chapters jsons in order! Loop through...  chapters.forEach(function(chapter) {\n  // ...and add to the page    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);\n\n});\n  addTextToPage(\"All done\");\n}).catch(function(err) {\n// catch any error that happened so far  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);\n}).then(function() {\ndocument.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Depending on connection, this can be seconds faster than loading one-by-one, and it's less code than our first try. The chapters can download in whatever order, but they appear on screen in the right order.</p>\n<p>However, we can still improve perceived performance. When chapter one arrives we should add it to the page. This lets the user start reading before the rest of the chapters have arrived. When chapter three arrives, we wouldn't add it to the page because the user may not realize chapter two is missing. When chapter two arrives, we can add chapters two and three, etc etc.</p>\n<p>To do this, we fetch JSON for all our chapters at the same time, then create a sequence to add them to the document:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {\naddHtmlToPage(story.heading);\n  // Map our array of chapter urls to  // an array of chapter json promises.  // This makes sure they all download in parallel.  return story.chapterUrls.map(getJSON)    .reduce(function(sequence, chapterPromise) {\n    // Use reduce to chain the promises together,      // adding content to the page for each chapter      return sequence      .then(function() {\n      // Wait for everything in the sequence so far,        // then wait for this chapter to arrive.        return chapterPromise;      }).then(function(chapter) {\n      addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);\n\n});\n    }, Promise.resolve());\n}).then(function() {\naddTextToPage(\"All done\");\n}).catch(function(err) {\n// catch any error that happened along the way  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);\n}).then(function() {\ndocument.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Async Await:</h2>\n<details>\n<summary> Async Await:  </summary>\n<h2>The basics of async/await</h2>\n<p>There are two parts to using async/await in your code.</p>\n<h3>The async keyword</h3>\n<p>First of all we have the <code>async</code> keyword, which you put in front of a function declaration to turn it into an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function\">async function</a>. An async function is a function that knows how to expect the possibility of the <code>await</code> keyword being used to invoke asynchronous code.</p>\n<p>Try typing the following lines into your browser's JS console:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">function hello() { return \"Hello\" };\nhello();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The function returns \"Hello\" — nothing special, right?</p>\n<p>But what if we turn this into an async function? Try the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function hello() { return \"Hello\" };\nhello();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Ah. Invoking the function now returns a promise. This is one of the traits of async functions — their return values are guaranteed to be converted to promises.</p>\n<p>You can also create an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/async_function\">async function expression</a>, like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">let hello = async function() { return \"Hello\" };\nhello();\n</code></pre>\n<p>And you can use <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions\">arrow functions</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">let hello = async () => \"Hello\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>These all do basically the same thing.</p>\n<p>To actually consume the value returned when the promise fulfills, since it is returning a promise, we could use a <code>.then()</code> block:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">hello().then((value) => console.log(value))\n</code></pre>\n<p>or even just shorthand such as</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">hello().then(console.log);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Like we saw in the last article.</p>\n<p>So the <code>async</code> keyword is added to functions to tell them to return a promise rather than directly returning the value.</p>\n<h3>The await keyword</h3>\n<p>The advantage of an async function only becomes apparent when you combine it with the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await\">await</a> keyword. <code>await</code> only works inside async functions within regular JavaScript code, however it can be used on its own with <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules\">JavaScript modules.</a></p>\n<p><code>await</code> can be put in front of any async promise-based function to pause your code on that line until the promise fulfills, then return the resulting value.</p>\n<p>You can use <code>await</code> when calling any function that returns a Promise, including web API functions.</p>\n<p>Here is a trivial example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function hello() {\n  return await Promise.resolve(\"Hello\");\n\n};\n\nhello().then(alert);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, the above example is not very useful, although it does serve to illustrate the syntax. Let's move on and look at a real example.</p>\n<h2>Rewriting promise code with async/await</h2>\n<p>Let's look back at a simple fetch example that we saw in the previous article:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">fetch('coffee.jpg')\n  .then(response => {\n    if (!response.ok) {\n      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n\n    }\n    return response.blob();\n\n  })\n  .then(myBlob => {\n    let objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(myBlob);\n\n    let image = document.createElement('img');\n\n    image.src = objectURL;\n    document.body.appendChild(image);\n\n  })\n  .catch(e => {\n    console.log('There has been a problem with your fetch operation: ' + e.message);\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>By now, you should have a reasonable understanding of promises and how they work, but let's convert this to use async/await to see how much simpler it makes things:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function myFetch() {\n  let response = await fetch('coffee.jpg');\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n\n  }\n\n  let myBlob = await response.blob();\n\n  let objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(myBlob);\n\n  let image = document.createElement('img');\n\n  image.src = objectURL;\n  document.body.appendChild(image);\n\n}\n\nmyFetch()\n  .catch(e => {\n    console.log('There has been a problem with your fetch operation: ' + e.message);\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>It makes code much simpler and easier to understand — no more <code>.then()</code> blocks everywhere!</p>\n<p>Since an <code>async</code> keyword turns a function into a promise, you could refactor your code to use a hybrid approach of promises and await, bringing the second half of the function out into a new block to make it more flexible:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function myFetch() {\n  let response = await fetch('coffee.jpg');\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n\n  }\n  return await response.blob();\n\n}\n\nmyFetch()\n  .then(blob => {\n    let objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n\n    let image = document.createElement('img');\n\n    image.src = objectURL;\n    document.body.appendChild(image);\n\n  })\n  .catch(e => console.log(e));\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can try typing in the example yourself, or running our <a href=\"https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/simple-fetch-async-await.html\">live example</a> (see also the <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/simple-fetch-async-await.html\">source code</a>).</p>\n<h3>But how does it work?</h3>\n<p>You'll note that we've wrapped the code inside a function, and we've included the <code>async</code> keyword before the <code>function</code> keyword. This is necessary — you have to create an async function to define a block of code in which you'll run your async code; as we said earlier, <code>await</code> only works inside of async functions.</p>\n<p>Inside the <code>myFetch()</code> function definition you can see that the code closely resembles the previous promise version, but there are some differences. Instead of needing to chain a <code>.then()</code> block on to the end of each promise-based method, you just need to add an <code>await</code> keyword before the method call, and then assign the result to a variable. The <code>await</code> keyword causes the JavaScript runtime to pause your code on this line, not allowing further code to execute in the meantime until the async function call has returned its result — very useful if subsequent code relies on that result!</p>\n<p>Once that's complete, your code continues to execute starting on the next line. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">let response = await fetch('coffee.jpg');\n</code></pre>\n<p>The response returned by the fulfilled <code>fetch()</code> promise is assigned to the <code>response</code> variable when that response becomes available, and the parser pauses on this line until that occurs. Once the response is available, the parser moves to the next line, which creates a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob\"><code>Blob</code></a> out of it. This line also invokes an async promise-based method, so we use <code>await</code> here as well. When the result of operation returns, we return it out of the <code>myFetch()</code> function.</p>\n<p>This means that when we call the <code>myFetch()</code> function, it returns a promise, so we can chain a <code>.then()</code> onto the end of it inside which we handle displaying the blob onscreen.</p>\n<p>You are probably already thinking \"this is really cool!\", and you are right — fewer <code>.then()</code> blocks to wrap around code, and it mostly just looks like synchronous code, so it is really intuitive.</p>\n<h3>Adding error handling</h3>\n<p>And if you want to add error handling, you've got a couple of options.</p>\n<p>You can use a synchronous <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch\"><code>try...catch</code></a> structure with <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. This example expands on the first version of the code we showed above:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function myFetch() {\n  try {\n    let response = await fetch('coffee.jpg');\n\n    if (!response.ok) {\n      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n\n    }\n    let myBlob = await response.blob();\n\n    let objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(myBlob);\n\n    let image = document.createElement('img');\n\n    image.src = objectURL;\n    document.body.appendChild(image);\n\n  } catch(e) {\n    console.log(e);\n\n  }\n}\n\nmyFetch();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>catch() {}</code> block is passed an error object, which we've called <code>e</code>; we can now log that to the console, and it will give us a detailed error message showing where in the code the error was thrown.</p>\n<p>If you wanted to use the second (refactored) version of the code that we showed above, you would be better off just continuing the hybrid approach and chaining a <code>.catch()</code> block onto the end of the <code>.then()</code> call, like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function myFetch() {\n  let response = await fetch('coffee.jpg');\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n\n  }\n  return await response.blob();\n\n}\n\nmyFetch()\n  .then(blob => {\n    let objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n\n    let image = document.createElement('img');\n\n    image.src = objectURL;\n    document.body.appendChild(image);\n\n  })\n  .catch(e => console.log(e));\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is because the <code>.catch()</code> block will catch errors occurring in both the async function call and the promise chain. If you used the <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> block here, you might still get unhandled errors in the <code>myFetch()</code> function when it's called.</p>\n<p>You can find both of these examples on GitHub:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/simple-fetch-async-await-try-catch.html\">simple-fetch-async-await-try-catch.html</a> (see <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/simple-fetch-async-await-try-catch.html\">source code</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/simple-fetch-async-await-promise-catch.html\">simple-fetch-async-await-promise-catch.html</a> (see <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/simple-fetch-async-await-promise-catch.html\">source code</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Awaiting a Promise.all()</h2>\n<p>async/await is built on top of <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">promises</a>, so it's compatible with all the features offered by promises. This includes <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all\"><code>Promise.all()</code></a> — you can quite happily await a <code>Promise.all()</code> call to get all the results returned into a variable in a way that looks like simple synchronous code. Again, let's return to <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/asynchronous/promises/promise-all.html\">an example we saw in our previous article</a>. Keep it open in a separate tab so you can compare and contrast with the new version shown below.</p>\n<p>Converting this to async/await (see <a href=\"https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/promise-all-async-await.html\">live demo</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/promise-all-async-await.html\">source code</a>), this now looks like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function fetchAndDecode(url, type) {\n  let response = await fetch(url);\n\n  let content;\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n\n  } else {\n    if(type === 'blob') {\n      content = await response.blob();\n\n    } else if(type === 'text') {\n      content = await response.text();\n\n    }\n  }\n  return content;\n}\n\nasync function displayContent() {\n  let coffee = fetchAndDecode('coffee.jpg', 'blob');\n\n  let tea = fetchAndDecode('tea.jpg', 'blob');\n\n  let description = fetchAndDecode('description.txt', 'text');\n\n  let values = await Promise.all([coffee, tea, description]);\n\n  let objectURL1 = URL.createObjectURL(values[0]);\n\n  let objectURL2 = URL.createObjectURL(values[1]);\n\n  let descText = values[2];\n\n  let image1 = document.createElement('img');\n\n  let image2 = document.createElement('img');\n\n  image1.src = objectURL1;\n  image2.src = objectURL2;\n  document.body.appendChild(image1);\n\n  document.body.appendChild(image2);\n\n  let para = document.createElement('p');\n\n  para.textContent = descText;\n  document.body.appendChild(para);\n\n}\n\ndisplayContent()\n  .catch(e => console.log(e));\n</code></pre>\n<p>You'll see that the <code>fetchAndDecode()</code> function has been converted easily into an async function with just a few changes. See the <code>Promise.all()</code> line:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">let values = await Promise.all([coffee, tea, description]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>By using <code>await</code> here we are able to get all the results of the three promises returned into the <code>values</code> array, when they are all available, in a way that looks very much like sync code. We've had to wrap all the code in a new async function, <code>displayContent()</code>, and we've not reduced the code by a lot of lines, but being able to move the bulk of the code out of the <code>.then()</code> block provides a nice, useful simplification, leaving us with a much more readable program.</p>\n<p>For error handling, we've included a <code>.catch()</code> block on our <code>displayContent()</code> call; this will handle errors occurring in both functions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is also possible to use a sync <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch#the_finally_clause\"><code>finally</code></a> block within an async function, in place of a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/finally\"><code>.finally()</code></a> async block, to show a final report on how the operation went — you can see this in action in our <a href=\"https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/promise-finally-async-await.html\">live example</a> (see also the <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/promise-finally-async-await.html\">source code</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Handling async/await slowdown</h2>\n<p>Async/await makes your code look synchronous, and in a way it makes it behave more synchronously. The <code>await</code> keyword blocks execution of all the code that follows it until the promise fulfills, exactly as it would with a synchronous operation. It does allow other tasks to continue to run in the meantime, but the awaited code is blocked. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function makeResult(items) {\n  let newArr = [];\n  for(let i = 0; i &#x3C; items.length; i++) {\n    newArr.push('word_' + i);\n\n  }\n  return newArr;\n}\n\nasync function getResult() {\n  let result = await makeResult(items);\n // Blocked on this line\n  useThatResult(result);\n // Will not be executed before makeResult() is done\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a result, your code could be slowed down by a significant number of awaited promises happening straight after one another. Each <code>await</code> will wait for the previous one to finish, whereas actually what you might want is for the promises to begin processing simultaneously, like they would do if we weren't using async/await.</p>\n<p>Let's look at two examples — <a href=\"https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/slow-async-await.html\">slow-async-await.html</a> (see <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/slow-async-await.html\">source code</a>) and <a href=\"https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/fast-async-await.html\">fast-async-await.html</a> (see <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/asynchronous/async-await/fast-async-await.html\">source code</a>). Both of them start off with a custom promise function that fakes an async process with a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout\"><code>setTimeout()</code></a> call:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">function timeoutPromise(interval) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve(\"done\");\n\n    }, interval);\n\n});\n\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then each one includes a <code>timeTest()</code> async function that awaits three <code>timeoutPromise()</code> calls:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function timeTest() {\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each one ends by recording a start time, seeing how long the <code>timeTest()</code> promise takes to fulfill, then recording an end time and reporting how long the operation took in total:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">let startTime = Date.now();\n\ntimeTest()\n  .then(() => {\n    let finishTime = Date.now();\n\n    let timeTaken = finishTime - startTime;\n    alert(\"Time taken in milliseconds: \" + timeTaken);\n\n  })\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is the <code>timeTest()</code> function that differs in each case.</p>\n<p>In the <code>slow-async-await.html</code> example, <code>timeTest()</code> looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function timeTest() {\n  await timeoutPromise(3000);\n\n  await timeoutPromise(3000);\n\n  await timeoutPromise(3000);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we await all three <code>timeoutPromise()</code> calls directly, making each one alert after 3 seconds. Each subsequent one is forced to wait until the last one finished — if you run the first example, you'll see the alert box reporting a total run time of around 9 seconds.</p>\n<p>In the <code>fast-async-await.html</code> example, <code>timeTest()</code> looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">async function timeTest() {\n  const timeoutPromise1 = timeoutPromise(3000);\n\n  const timeoutPromise2 = timeoutPromise(3000);\n\n  const timeoutPromise3 = timeoutPromise(3000);\n\n  await timeoutPromise1;\n  await timeoutPromise2;\n  await timeoutPromise3;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we store the three <code>Promise</code> objects in variables, which has the effect of setting off their associated processes all running simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Next, we await their results — because the promises all started processing at essentially the same time, the promises will all fulfill at the same time; when you run the second example, you'll see the alert box reporting a total run time of just over 3 seconds!</p>\n<h3>Handling errors</h3>\n<p>There is an issue with the above pattern however — it could lead to unhandled errors.</p>\n<p>Let's update the previous examples, this time adding a rejected promise and a <code>catch</code> statement in the end:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">function timeoutPromiseResolve(interval) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve(\"successful\");\n\n    }, interval);\n\n});\n\n};\n\nfunction timeoutPromiseReject(interval) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      reject(\"error\");\n\n    }, interval);\n\n});\n\n};\n\nasync function timeTest() {\n  await timeoutPromiseResolve(5000);\n\n  await timeoutPromiseReject(2000);\n\n  await timeoutPromiseResolve(3000);\n\n}\n\nlet startTime = Date.now();\n\ntimeTest()\n  .then(() => {})\n  .catch(e => {\n    console.log(e);\n\n    let finishTime = Date.now();\n\n    let timeTaken = finishTime - startTime;\n    alert(\"Time taken in milliseconds: \" + timeTaken);\n\n  })\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above example, the error is handled properly, and the alert appears after approximately 7 seconds.</p>\n<p>Now onto the second pattern:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">function timeoutPromiseResolve(interval) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve(\"successful\");\n\n    }, interval);\n\n});\n\n};\n\nfunction timeoutPromiseReject(interval) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      reject(\"error\");\n\n    }, interval);\n\n});\n\n};\n\nasync function timeTest() {\n  const timeoutPromiseResolve1 = timeoutPromiseResolve(5000);\n\n  const timeoutPromiseReject2 = timeoutPromiseReject(2000);\n\n  const timeoutPromiseResolve3 = timeoutPromiseResolve(3000);\n\n  await timeoutPromiseResolve1;\n  await timeoutPromiseReject2;\n  await timeoutPromiseResolve3;\n}\n\nlet startTime = Date.now();\n\ntimeTest()\n  .then(() => {})\n  .catch(e => {\n    console.log(e);\n\n    let finishTime = Date.now();\n\n    let timeTaken = finishTime - startTime;\n    alert(\"Time taken in milliseconds: \" + timeTaken);\n\n  })\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, we have an unhandled error in the console (after 2 seconds), and the alert appears after approximately 5 seconds.</p>\n<p>To start the promises in parallel and catch the error properly, we could use <code>Promise.all()</code>, as discussed earlier:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">function timeoutPromiseResolve(interval) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve(\"successful\");\n\n    }, interval);\n\n});\n\n};\n\nfunction timeoutPromiseReject(interval) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      reject(\"error\");\n\n    }, interval);\n\n});\n\n};\n\nasync function timeTest() {\n  const timeoutPromiseResolve1 = timeoutPromiseResolve(5000);\n\n  const timeoutPromiseReject2 = timeoutPromiseReject(2000);\n\n  const timeoutPromiseResolve3 = timeoutPromiseResolve(3000);\n\n  const results = await Promise.all([timeoutPromiseResolve1, timeoutPromiseReject2, timeoutPromiseResolve3]);\n\n  return results;\n}\n\nlet startTime = Date.now();\n\ntimeTest()\n  .then(() => {})\n  .catch(e => {\n    console.log(e);\n\n    let finishTime = Date.now();\n\n    let timeTaken = finishTime - startTime;\n    alert(\"Time taken in milliseconds: \" + timeTaken);\n\n  })\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, the error is handled properly after around 2 seconds and we also see the alert after around 2 seconds.</p>\n<p>The <code>Promise.all()</code> rejects when any of the input promises are rejected. If you want all the promises to settle and then use some of their fulfilled values, even when some of\nthem are rejected, you could use <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled\"><code>Promise.allSettled()</code></a> instead.</p>\n<h2>Async/await class methods</h2>\n<p>As a final note before we move on, you can even add <code>async</code> in front of class/object methods to make them return promises, and <code>await</code> promises inside them. Take a look at the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance#ecmascript_2015_classes\">ES class code we saw in our object-oriented JavaScript article</a>, and then look at our modified version with an <code>async</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">class Person {\n  constructor(first, last, age, gender, interests) {\n    this.name = {\n      first,\n      last\n    };\n    this.age = age;\n    this.gender = gender;\n    this.interests = interests;\n  }\n\n  async greeting() {\n    return await Promise.resolve(`Hi! I'm ${this.name.first}`);\n\n  };\n\n  farewell() {\n    console.log(`${this.name.first} has left the building. Bye for now!`);\n\n  };\n}\n\nlet han = new Person('Han', 'Solo', 25, 'male', ['Smuggling']);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first class method could now be used something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsjs\">han.greeting().then(console.log);\n</code></pre>\n</details>"}
