Identify when to use . vs [] when accessing values of an object</h4>\n<pre><code>let obj = {\n    \"one\": 1,\n    \"two\": 2\n};\n\n// Choose the square brackets property accessor when the property name is determined at\n// runtime, or if the property name is not a valid identifier\nlet myKey = \"one\";\nconsole.log(obj[myKey]);\n\n// Choose the dot property accessor when the property name is known ahead of time.\nconsole.log(obj.two);\n</code></pre>\n<h4>3. Write an object literal with a variable key using interpolation</h4>\n<pre><code>let keyName = \"two\";\n\n// If the key is not known, you can use an alternative `[]` syntax for\n// object initialization only\nlet obj2 = {\n    [keyName]: 2\n}\nconsole.log(obj2);\n</code></pre>\n<h4>4. Use the obj[key] !== undefined pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object</h4>\n<pre><code>function doesKeyExist(obj, key) {\n    // obj[key] !== undefined\n    // or:\n    return key in obj;\n}\n\nlet course = {\n    bootcamp: 'Lambda',\n    course: 'Bootcamp Prep'\n}\nconsole.log(doesKeyExist(course, 'course')); // => true\nconsole.log(doesKeyExist(course, 'name')); // => false\n</code></pre>\n<h4>5. Utilize Object.keys and Object.values in a function</h4>\n<pre><code>function printKeys(object) {\n    return Object.keys(object);\n}\n\nfunction printValues(object) {\n    return Object.values(object);\n}\n\nconsole.log(printKeys({\n    dog: \"Strelka\",\n    dog2: \"Belka\"\n}));\nconsole.log(printValues({\n    dog: \"Strelka\",\n    dog2: \"Belka\"\n}));\n</code></pre>\n<h4>6.

Identify the difference between const, let, and var declarations</h4>\n<h4>2. Explain the difference between const, let, and var declarations</h4>\n<pre><code>var a = \"a\";\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"2dba\"><code>var</code> is the historical keyword used for variable declaration.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"50d3\"><code>var</code> declares variables in function scope, or global scope if not inside a function.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"4bc8\">We consider <code>var</code> to be deprecated and it is never used in this course.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<pre><code>let b = \"b\";\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"8bab\"><code>let</code> is the keyword we use most often for variable declaration.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"0642\"><code>let</code> declares variables in block scope.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"bf7b\">variables declared with <code>let</code> are re-assignable.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<pre><code>const c = \"c\";\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"e199\"><code>const</code> is a specialized form of <code>let</code> that can only be used to <strong>initialize</strong> a variable.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"4522\">Except when it is declared, you cannot assign to a <code>const</code> variable.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"4e5a\"><code>const</code> scopes variables the same way that <code>let</code> does.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining</h4>\n<p>Consider this <code>run</code> function, inside which <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> have <code>function scope</code> . <code>i</code> and <code>baz</code> are scoped to the block expression.</p>\n<pre><code>// function and block scope in this example\nfunction run() {\n    var foo = \"Foo\";\n    let bar = \"Bar\";\n\n    console.log(foo, bar);\n\n    {\n        console.log(foo);\n        let baz = \"Bazz\";\n        console.log(baz);\n    }\n\n    console.log(baz); // ReferenceError\n}\n\nrun();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that referencing <code>baz</code> from outside it's block results in JavaScript throwing a ReferenceError.</p>\n<p>Consider this <code>run</code> function, inside of which <code>foo</code> has <code>function scope</code> .</p>\n<pre><code>function run() {\n    console.log(foo); // undefined\n    var foo = \"Foo\";\n    console.log(foo); // Foo\n}\n\nrun();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Consider this <code>func1</code> function and it's nested scopes.</p>\n<pre><code>// global scope\nfunction func1(arg1) {\n    // func1 scope\n\n    return function func2(arg2) {\n        // func2 scope\n\n        return function func3(arg3) {\n            // func3 scope\n\n            console.log(arg1, arg2, arg3);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>6. Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope</h4>\n<pre><code>const adder = (arg1) => {\n    return (arg2) => {\n        return arg1 + arg2;\n    }\n};\n\nconst func2 = adder(2);\nconst result = func2(2);\nconsole.log(result); // => 4;\n</code></pre>\n<h4>4. Define an arrow function</h4>\n<pre><code>const returnValue = (val) => val;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This simple construct will create a function that accepts <code>val</code> as a parameter, and returns <code>val</code> immediately. We do not need to type <code>return val</code> , because this is a single-line function.</p>\n<p>Identically, we could write</p>\n<pre><code>const returnValue = (val) => {\n    return val;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h4>5. Given an arrow function, deduce the value of <code>this</code> without executing the code</h4>\n<pre><code>function fDAdder(arr) {\n    console.log(this);\n\n    return arr.reduce((acc, ele) => {\n        return acc + ele;\n    });\n};\n\nfDAdder([1, 2, 4, 6]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we use a function declaration style function, the <code>this</code> variable is set to the <code>global</code> object (i.e. <code>Object [global]</code> in Node. JS and <code>Window</code> in your browser).</p>\n<pre><code>const adder = (arr) => {\n    console.log(this);\n    arr.reduce((acc, ele) => sum += ele);\n};\nadder([1, 2, 4, 6]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, we use a fat arrow style function. Note that when we declare a functions like this <code>this</code> becomes</p>\n<h4>7. Define a method that references this on an object literal</h4>\n<pre><code>const pokemon = {\n    firstname: 'Pika',\n    lastname: 'Chu',\n    getPokeName: function() {\n        const fullname = `${this.firstname} ${this.lastname}`;\n        return fullname;\n    }\n};\n\nconsole.log(pokemon.getPokeName());\n</code></pre>\n<h4>8. Utilize the built in Function#bind on a callback to maintain the context of <code>this</code></h4>\n<pre><code>const pokemon = {\n    firstname: 'Pika',\n    lastname: 'Chu',\n    getPokeName: function() {\n        const fullname = `${this.firstname} ${this.lastname}`;\n        return fullname;\n    }\n};\n\nconst logPokemon = pokemon.getPokename.bind(pokemon);\n\nlogPokemon('sushi', 'algorithms'); // Pika Chu loves sushi and algorithms\n</code></pre>\n<h4>9. Given a code snippet, identify what <code>this</code> refers to</h4>\n<pre><code>function Person(name) {\n    // this.name = name;\n    // let that = this;\n\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        // console.log(this); // => Window\n        // console.log(that); // => [Function] => Person\n        // this.sayName(); // => no method error\n        that.sayName();\n    }, 1000);\n}\n\nPerson.prototype.sayName = function() {\n    console.log(this.name);\n};\n\nconst jane = new Person(\"Jane\");\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>---\n\n# The Complete JavaScript Reference Guide\n\n---\n\n### The Complete JavaScript Reference Guide\n\n&#x3C;figure>&#x3C;img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*In5wB-29T0Ud_zs3.jpg\" class=\"graf-image\" />&#x3C;/figure>### How to learn effectively\n\n**Learning**: The acquisition of skills and the ability to apply them in the future.\n\n**What makes an Effective learner?**\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"7504\">They are active listeners.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"179b\">They are engaged with the material.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"3193\">They are receptive of feedback.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"17d8\">They are open to difficulty.&#x3C;/span>\n\n**Why do active learning techniques feel difficult?**\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"7848\">It feels difficult because you are constantly receiving feedback, and so you are constantly adapting and perfecting the material.&#x3C;/span>\n\n**Desirable Difficulty**\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"67c9\">The skills we wish to obtain is often a difficult one.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"c939\">We want challenging but possible lessons based on current level of skill.&#x3C;/span>\n\n**Effective learners space their practice**\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"59a4\">Consistent effort &#x26;gt; cramming =&#x26;gt; for **durable knowledge**&#x3C;/span>\n\n---\n\n### Getting visual feedback in your programs\n\nThe first command we'll learn in JavaScript is `console.log`. This command is used to _print_ something onto the screen. As we write our first lines of code, we'll be using `console.log` frequently as a way to visually see the output of our programs. Let's write our first program:\n\n    console.log(\"hello world\");\n    console.log(\"how are you?\");\n\nExecuting the program above would print out the following:\n\n    hello world\n    how are you?\n\nNothing too ground breaking here, but pay close attention to the exact way we wrote the program. In particular, notice how we lay out the periods, parentheses, and quotation marks. We'll also terminate lines with semicolons (;).\n\n> _Depending on how you structure your code, sometimes you'll be able to omit semicolons at the end of lines. For now, you'll want to include them just as we do._\n\n### Syntax\n\nWe refer to the exact arrangement of the symbols, characters, and keywords as **syntax**. These details matter — your computer will only be able to \"understand\" proper JavaScript syntax. A programming language is similar to a spoken language. A spoken language like English has grammar rules that we should follow in order to be understood by fellow speakers. In the same way, a programming language like JavaScript has syntax rules that we ought to follow!\n\nAs you write your first lines of code in this new language, you may make many syntax errors. Don't get frustrated! This is normal — all new programmers go through this phase. Every time we recognize an error in our code, we have an opportunity to reinforce your understanding of correct syntax. Adopt a growth mindset and learn from your mistakes.\n\nAdditionally, one of the best things about programming is that we can get such immediate feedback from our creations. There is no penalty for making a mistake when programming. Write some code, run the code, read the errors, fix the errors, rinse and repeat!\n\n### Code comments\n\nOccasionally we'll want to leave **comments** or notes in our code. Commented lines will be ignored by our computer. This means that we can use comments to write plain english or temporarily avoid execution of some JavaScript lines. The proper _syntax_ for writing a comment is to begin the line with double forward slashes (`//`):\n\n    // let's write another program!!!\n    console.log(\"hello world\");\n\n    // console.log(\"how are you?\");\n\n    console.log(\"goodbye moon\");\n\nThe program above would only print:\n\n    hello world\n    goodbye moon\n\nComments are useful when annotating pieces of code to offer an explanation of how the code works. We'll want to strive to write straightforward code that is self-explanatory when possible, but we can also use comments to add additional clarity. The real art of programming is to write code so elegantly that it is easy to follow.\n\n**The Number Data Type**\n\nThe **number** data type in JS is used to represent any numerical values, including integers and decimal numbers.\n\n**Basic Arithmetic Operators**\n\nOperators are the symbols that perform particular operations.\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"f533\">**+** (addition)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"5b9f\">**-** (subtraction)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b98b\">**asterisk** (multiplication)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"9a15\">**/** (division)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"c752\">**%** (modulo)&#x3C;/span>\n\nJS evaluates more complex expressions using the general math order of operations aka PEMDAS.\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b6e3\">**PEMDAS** : Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Modulo, Addition, Subtraction.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"9c25\">_To force a specific order of operation, use the group operator ( ) around a part of the expression._&#x3C;/span>\n\n**Modulo** : Very useful operation to check divisibility of numbers, check for even &#x26; odd, whether a number is prime, and much more! _(Discrete Math concept, circular problems can be solved with modulo)_\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"cf5b\">Whenever you have a smaller number % a larger number, the answer will just be the initial small number.\n    console.log(7 % 10) // =&#x26;gt; 7;&#x3C;/span>\n\n**The String Data Type**\n\nThe **string** data type is a primitive data type that used to represent textual data.\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e1b0\">can be wrapped by either **single** or **double** quotation marks, _best to choose one and stick with it for consistency_.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"f8ad\">If your string contains quotation marks inside, can layer single or double quotation marks to allow it to work.\n    \"That's a great string\"; (valid)\n    'Shakespeare wrote, \"To be or not to be\"'; (valid)\n    'That's a bad string'; (invalid)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b2cb\">Alt. way to add other quotes within strings is to use template literals.\n- \\`This is a temp'l'ate literal ${function}\\` // use ${} to invoke functions within.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"7b1a\">**.length** : property that can be appended\n- &#x3C;span id=\"f633\">empty strings have a length of zero.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"0a07\">**indices** : indexes of data that begin at 0, can call upon index by using the bracket notation \\[ \\].\n    console.log(\"bootcamp\"\\[0\\]); // =&#x26;gt; \"b\"\n    console.log(\"bootcamp\"\\[10\\]); // =&#x26;gt; \"undefined\"\n    console.log(\"boots\"\\[1 \\* 2\\]); // =&#x26;gt; \"o\"\n    console.log(\"boots\"\\[\"boot\".length-1\\]); // =&#x26;gt; \"t\"&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"6482\">we can pass expressions through the brackets as well since JS always evaluates expressions first.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e2f5\">The index of the last character of a string is always one less than it's length.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"2271\">**indexOf()** : method used to find the first index of a given character within a string.\n    console.log(\"bagel\".indexOf(\"b\")); // =&#x26;gt; 0\n    console.log(\"bagel\".indexOf(\"z\")); // =&#x26;gt; -1&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"8d68\">if the character inside the indexOf() search does not exist in the string, the output will be -1.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"d15e\">the indexOf() search will return the first instanced index of the the char in the string.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"a275\">**concatenate** : word to describe joining strings together into a single string.&#x3C;/span>\n\n**The Boolean Data Type**\n\nThe **Boolean** data type is the simplest data type since there are only two values: **true** and **false**.\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"60da\">**Logical Operators** (B*oolean Operators*) are used to establish logic in our code.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"139b\">**!** (not) : reverses a Boolean value.\n    console.log(!true); // =&#x26;gt; false\n    console.log(!!false); // =&#x26;gt; false&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e412\">**Logical Order of Operations** : JS will evaluate !, then &#x26;&#x26;, then ||.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"99ad\">**Short-Circuit Evaluation** : Because JS evalutes from left to right, expressions can \"short-circuit\". For example if we have true on the left of an || logical comparison, it will stop evaluating and yield true instead of wasting resources on processing the rest of the statement.\n    console.log(true || !false) // =&#x26;gt; stops after it sees \"true ||\"&#x3C;/span>\n\n**Comparison Operators**\n\nAll comparison operators will result in a boolean output.\n\n**The relative comparators**\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"6fee\">**&#x26;gt;** (greater than)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"0437\">**&#x26;lt;** (less than)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"17ff\">**&#x26;gt;=** (greater than or equal to)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b2b4\">**&#x26;lt;=** (less than or equal to)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"0c13\">**===** (equal to)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b73a\">**!==** (not equal to)&#x3C;/span>\n\nFun Fact: \"a\" &#x26;lt; \"b\" is considered valid JS Code because string comparisons are compared lexicographically (meaning dictionary order), so \"a\" is less than \"b\" because it appears earlier!\n\nIf there is ever a standstill comparison of two string lexicographically (i.e. app vs apple) the comparison will deem the shorter string lesser.\n\n**Difference between == and ===**\n\n#### ===\n\nStrict Equality, will only return true if the two comparisons are entirely the same.\n\n#### ==\n\nLoose Equality, will return true even if the values are of a different type, due to coercion. (Avoid using this)\n\n**Variables**\n\nVariables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a program.\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"c73d\">We initialize a variable by using the **let** keyword and a **=** single equals sign (assignment operator).\n    let bootcamp = \"App Academy\";\n    console.log(bootcamp); // \"App Academy\"&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"7849\">JS variable names can contain any alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dollar signs (cannot being with a number).&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"ad76\">If you do not declare a value for a variable, undefined is automatically set.\n    let bootcamp;\n    console.log(bootcamp); // undefined&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"2188\">We can change the value of a previously declared variable (let, not const) by re-assigning it another value.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"47ca\">**let** is the updated version of **var**; there are some differences in terms of hoisting and global/block scope&#x3C;/span>\n\n**Assignment Shorthand**\n\nlet num = 0;\nnum += 10; // same as num = num + 10\nnum -= 2; // same as num = num — 2\nnum /= 4; // same as num = num / 4\nnum \\*= 7; // same as num = num \\* 7\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"9c05\">In general, any nonsensical arithmetic will result in **NaN** ; usually operations that include undefined.&#x3C;/span>\n\n**Functions**\n\nA function is a procedure of code that will run when called. Functions are used so that we do not have to rewrite code to do the same thing over and over. (Think of them as 'subprograms')\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"366f\">**Function Declaration** : Process when we first initially write our function.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"676f\">Includes three things:&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"80c2\">Name of the function.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"f3a4\">A list of _parameters_ ()&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"2b0e\">The code to execute {}&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"6879\">**Function Calls** : We can call upon our function whenever and wherever\\* we want. (\\*wherever is only after the initial declaration)&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"8374\">JS evaluates code top down, left to right.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"2687\">When we execute a declared function later on in our program we refer to this as **invoking** our function.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"0c3a\">Every function in JS returns undefined unless otherwise specified.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"4207\">When we hit a **return** statement in a function we immediately exit the function and return to where we called the function.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e39f\">When naming functions in JS always use camelCase and name it something appropriate.&#x3C;/span>\n\nGreate code reads like English and almost explains itself. Think: Elegant, readable, and maintainable!\n\n**Parameters and Arguments**\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e94e\">**Parameters** : Comma seperated variables specified as part of a function's declaration.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"6740\">**Arguments** : Values passed to the function when it is invoked.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"004c\">_If the number of arguments passed during a function invocation is different than the number of paramters listed, it will still work._&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"7da5\">However, is there are not enough arguments provided for parameters our function will likely yield **Nan**.&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Including Comments\n\nComments are important because they help other people understand what is going on in your code or remind you if you forgot something yourself. Keep in mind that they have to be marked properly so the browser won't try to execute them.\n\nIn JavaScript you have two different options:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"356d\">Single-line comments — To include a comment that is limited to a single line, precede it with `//`&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"ee3a\">Multi-line comments — In case you want to write longer comments between several lines, wrap it in `/*` and `*/` to avoid it from being executed&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Variables in JavaScript\n\nVariables are stand-in values that you can use to perform operations. You should be familiar with them from math class.\n\n### var, const, let\n\nYou have three different possibilities for declaring a variable in JavaScript, each with their own specialties:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"4b29\">`var` — The most common variable. It can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables defined with `var` move to the top when the code is executed.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"d234\">`const` — Can not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code.&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"0e3b\">`let` — Similar to `const`, the `let` variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Data Types\n\nVariables can contain different types of values and data types. You use `=` to assign them:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b276\">Numbers — `var age = 23`&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"5571\">Variables — `var x`&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e26c\">Text (strings) — `var a = \"init\"`&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"1312\">Operations — `var b = 1 + 2 + 3`&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"9880\">True or false statements — `var c = true`&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"335a\">Constant numbers — `const PI = 3.14`&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"7221\">Objects — `var name = {firstName:\"John\", lastName:\"Doe\"}`&#x3C;/span>\n\nThere are more possibilities. Note that variables are case sensitive. That means `lastname` and `lastName` will be handled as two different variables.\n\n### Objects\n\nObjects are certain kinds of variables. They are variables that can have their own values and methods. The latter are actions that you can perform on objects.\n\nvar person = {\n\nfirstName:\"John\",\n\nlastName:\"Doe\",\n\nage:20,\n\nnationality:\"German\"\n\n};\n\n### The Next Level: Arrays\n\nNext up in our JavaScript cheat sheet are arrays. Arrays are part of many different programming languages. They are a way of organizing variables and properties into groups. Here's how to create one in JavaScript:\n\nvar fruit = \\[\"Banana\", \"Apple\", \"Pear\"\\];\n\nNow you have an array called `fruit` which contains three items that you can use for future operations.\n\n### Array Methods\n\nOnce you have created arrays, there are a few things you can do with them:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"4e4b\">`concat()` — Join several arrays into one&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"5c02\">`indexOf()` — Returns the first position at which a given element appears in an array&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"45cd\">`join()` — Combine elements of an array into a single string and return the string&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"3a4e\">`lastIndexOf()` — Gives the last position at which a given element appears in an array&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"8fbb\">`pop()` — Removes the last element of an array&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"28e4\">`push()` — Add a new element at the end&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"0be2\">`reverse()` — Sort elements in a descending order&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"775e\">`shift()` — Remove the first element of an array&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"1063\">`slice()` — Pulls a copy of a portion of an array into a new array&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"53fd\">`sort()` — Sorts elements alphabetically&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"f551\">`splice()` — Adds elements in a specified way and position&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"c46b\">`toString()` — Converts elements to strings&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"ef66\">`unshift()` —Adds a new element to the beginning&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"4598\">`valueOf()` — Returns the primitive value of the specified object&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Operators\n\nIf you have variables, you can use them to perform different kinds of operations. To do so, you need operators.\n\n### Basic Operators\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"5d34\">`+` — Addition&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"5fd9\">`-` — Subtraction&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"3b13\">`*` — Multiplication&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"521a\">`/` — Division&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"cf0f\">`(...)` — Grouping operator, operations within brackets are executed earlier than those outside&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"bb2a\">`%` — Modulus (remainder )&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e837\">`++` — Increment numbers&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"71ea\">`--` — Decrement numbers&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Comparison Operators\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"a2b0\">`==` — Equal to&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"5105\">`===` — Equal value and equal type&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"c79c\">`!=` — Not equal&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"1f7f\">`!==` — Not equal value or not equal type&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"78c3\">`>` — Greater than&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"d40b\">`&#x3C;` — Less than&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"081b\">`>=` — Greater than or equal to&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"d065\">`&#x3C;=` — Less than or equal to&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"174d\">`?` — Ternary operator&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Logical Operators\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"cb7b\">`&#x26;&#x26;` — Logical and&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b1ee\">`||` — Logical or&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"96d4\">`!` — Logical not&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Bitwise Operators\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"8cf7\">`&#x26;` — AND statement&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"02d5\">`|` — OR statement&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e576\">`~` — NOT&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"9c66\">`^` — XOR&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b343\">`&#x3C;&#x3C;` — Left shift&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"52b1\">`>>` — Right shift&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"1b5c\">`>>>` — Zero fill right shift&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Functions\n\nJavaScript functions are blocks of code that perform a certain task. A basic function looks like this:\n\nfunction name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {\n\n// what the function does\n\n}\n\nAs you can see, it consists of the `function` keyword plus a name. The function's parameters are in the brackets and you have curly brackets around what the function performs. You can create your own, but to make your life easier - there are also a number of default functions.\n\n### Outputting Data\n\nA common application for functions is the output of data. For the output, you have the following options:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"a7a7\">`alert()` — Output data in an alert box in the browser window&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"0c44\">`confirm()` — Opens up a yes/no dialog and returns true/false depending on user click&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"9690\">`console.log()` — Writes information to the browser console, good for debugging purposes&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"0d4d\">`document.write()` — Write directly to the HTML document&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"16aa\">`prompt()` — Creates a dialogue for user input&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Global Functions\n\nGlobal functions are functions built into every browser capable of running JavaScript.\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"f4f1\">`decodeURI()` — Decodes a &#x3C;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\">Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)&#x3C;/a> created by `encodeURI` or similar&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"c203\">`decodeURIComponent()` — Decodes a URI component&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"176a\">`encodeURI()` — Encodes a URI into UTF-8&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"6720\">`encodeURIComponent()` — Same but for URI components&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e97b\">`eval()` — Evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"390b\">`isFinite()` — Determines whether a passed value is a finite number&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"5d46\">`isNaN()` — Determines whether a value is NaN or not&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"f668\">`Number()` —- Returns a number converted from its argument&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"a5ff\">`parseFloat()` — Parses an argument and returns a floating-point number&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"a666\">`parseInt()` — Parses its argument and returns an integer&#x3C;/span>\n\n### JavaScript Loops\n\nLoops are part of most programming languages. They allow you to execute blocks of code desired number of times with different values:\n\nfor (before loop; condition **for** loop; execute after loop) {\n\n// what to do during the loop\n\n}\n\nYou have several parameters to create loops:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"ff62\">`for` — The most common way to create a loop in JavaScript&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"7ad1\">`while` — Sets up conditions under which a loop executes&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"c2f4\">`do while` — Similar to the `while` loop but it executes at least once and performs a check at the end to see if the condition is met to execute again&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"7157\">`break` —Used to stop and exit the cycle at certain conditions&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"f5c0\">`continue` — Skip parts of the cycle if certain conditions are met&#x3C;/span>\n\n### If — Else Statements\n\nThese types of statements are easy to understand. Using them, you can set conditions for when your code is executed. If certain conditions apply, something is done, if not — something else is executed.\n\nif (condition) {\n\n// what to do if condition is met\n\n} **else** {\n\n// what to do if condition is not met\n\n}\n\nA similar concept to `if else` is the `switch` statement. However, using the switch you select one of several code blocks to execute.\n\n### Strings\n\nStrings are what JavaScript calls to text that does not perform a function but can appear on the screen.\n\nvar person = \"John Doe\";\n\nIn this case, `John Doe` is the string.\n\n### Escape Characters\n\nIn JavaScript, strings are marked with single or double-quotes. If you want to use quotation marks in a string, you need to use special characters:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b4b1\">`\\'` — Single quote&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"3b22\">`\\\"` — Double quote&#x3C;/span>\n\nAside from that you also have additional escape characters:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b412\">`\\\\` — Backslash&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"1592\">`\\b` — Backspace&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"3a72\">`\\f` — Form feed&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"145a\">`\\n` — New line&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"1416\">`\\r` — Carriage return&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"95d4\">`\\t` — Horizontal tabulator&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"d962\">`\\v` — Vertical tabulator&#x3C;/span>\n\n### String Methods\n\nThere are many different ways to work with strings:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"2021\">`charAt()` — Returns a character at a specified position inside a string&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"d3e5\">`charCodeAt()` — Gives you the Unicode of a character at that position&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"fdd1\">`concat()` — Concatenates (joins) two or more strings into one&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"009c\">`fromCharCode()` — Returns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"7ed3\">`indexOf()` — Provides the position of the first occurrence of a specified text within a string&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"2937\">`lastIndexOf()` — Same as `indexOf()` but with the last occurrence, searching backward&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"142d\">`match()` — Retrieves the matches of a string against a search pattern&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"6c18\">`replace()` — Find and replace specified text in a string&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e279\">`search()` — Executes a search for a matching text and returns its position&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"6bcd\">`slice()` — Extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"e4ee\">`split()` — Splits a string object into an array of strings at a specified position&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"3a27\">`substr()` — Similar to `slice()` but extracts a substring depending on a specified number of characters&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"3d14\">`substring()` — Also similar to `slice()` but can't accept negative indices&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"fa33\">`toLowerCase()` — Convert strings to lower case&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"3485\">`toUpperCase()` — Convert strings to upper case&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"4f96\">`valueOf()` — Returns the primitive value (that has no properties or methods) of a string object&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Regular Expression Syntax\n\nRegular expressions are search patterns used to match character combinations in strings. The search pattern can be used for text search and text to replace operations.\n\n### Pattern Modifiers\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"bb29\">`e` — Evaluate replacement&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span

It has two properties:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"ca3b\">`name` — Sets or returns the error name&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"7047\">`message` — Sets or returns an error message in a string from&#x3C;/span>\n\nThe error property can return six different values as its name:\n\n- &#x3C;span id=\"b389\">`EvalError` — An error has occurred in the `eval()` function&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"570c\">`RangeError` — A number is \"out of range\"&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"2352\">`ReferenceError` — An illegal reference has occurred&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"5019\">`SyntaxError` — A syntax error has occurred&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"0527\">`TypeError` — A type error has occurred&#x3C;/span>\n- &#x3C;span id=\"02a3\">`URIError` — An `encodeURI()` error has occurred&#x3C;/span>\n\n### Explicit Conversions\n\nThe simplest way to perform an explicit type conversion is to use the `Boolean(), Number()`, and `String()` functions.\n\nAny value other than `null`or `undefined`has a`toString()` method.\n\n`n.toString(2);`\n\nbinary\n\n`n.toString(8);`\n\noctal\n\n`n.toString(16);`\n\nhex\n\n`let n = 123456.789;`\n\n`n.toFixed(0)`\n\n\"123457\"\n\n`n.toFixed(5)`\n\n\"123456.78900\"\n\n`n.toExponential(3)`\n\n\"1.235e+5\"\n\n`n.toPrecision(7)`\n\n\"123456.8\"\n\n`n.toPrecision(10)`\n\n\"123456.7890\"\n\n`parseInt(\"3 blind mice\")`\n\n3\n\n`parseFloat(\" 3.14 meters\")`\n\n3.14\n\n`parseInt(\"-12.34\")`\n\n-12\n\n`parseInt(\"0xFF\")`\n\n255\n\n### Types, Values, and Variables\n\n### Links\n\n**Resource**\n\n**URL**\n\nMDN\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"&#x3C;&#x3C;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript>>\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript&#x3C;/a>\n\nRun Snippets\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"&#x3C;&#x3C;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/snippets>>\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/snippets&#x3C;/a>\n\n### Explicit Conversions\n\nThe simplest way to perform an explicit type conversion is to use the `Boolean(), Number()`, and `String()` functions.\n\nAny value other than `null`or `undefined`has a`toString()` method.\n\n`n.toString(2);`\n\nbinary\n\n`n.toString(8);`\n\noctal\n\n`n.toString(16);`\n\nhex\n\n`let n = 123456.789;`\n\n`n.toFixed(0)`\n\n\"123457\"\n\n`n.toFixed(5)`\n\n\"123456.78900\"\n\n`n.toExponential(3)`\n\n\"1.235e+5\"\n\n`n.toPrecision(7)`\n\n\"123456.8\"\n\n`n.toPrecision(10)`\n\n\"123456.7890\"\n\n`parseInt(\"3 blind mice\")`\n\n3\n\n`parseFloat(\" 3.14 meters\")`\n\n3.14\n\n`parseInt(\"-12.34\")`\n\n-12\n\n`parseInt(\"0xFF\")`\n\n255\n\n`parseInt(\"0xff\")`\n\n255\n\n`parseInt(\"-0XFF\")`\n\n-255\n\n`parseInt(\"0.1\")`\n\n0\n\n`parseInt(\".1\")`\n\nNaN: integers can't start with \".\"\n\n`parseFloat(\"$72.47\")`\n\nNaN: numbers can't start with \"$\"\n\nSupply Radix\n\n`parseInt(\"11\", 2)`\n\n3\n\n`parseInt(\"ff\", 16)`\n\n255\n\n`parseInt(\"077\", 8)`\n\n63\n\n### Conversion Idioms\n\n`x + \"\"`\n\n`String(x)`\n\n`+x`\n\n`Number(x)`\n\n`x-0`\n\n`Number(x)`\n\n`!!x`\n\n`Boolean(x)`\n\n### Destructuring Assignment\n\n`let [x,y] = [1,2];`\n\nlet x=1, y=2\n\n`[x,y] = [x + 1,y + 1];`\n\nx = x + 1, y = y + 1\n\n`[x,y] = [y,x];`\n\nSwap the value of the two variables\n\nDestructuring assignment makes it easy to work with functions that return arrays of values:\n\n`let [r,theta] = toPolar(1.0, 1.0);`\n\n    function toPolar(x, y) {\n\n    return [Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y), Math.atan2(y,x)];\n\n    }\n\nVariable destructuring in loops:\n\n`let o = { x: 1, y: 2 };`\n\n    for(const [name, value] of Object.entries(o)) {\n\n    console.log(name, value); // Prints \"x 1\" and \"y 2\"\n\n    }\n\n**Note**: The `Object.entries()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property `[key, value]` pairs, in the same order as that provided by a `for...in` loop. (The only important difference is that a `for...in` loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well).\n\nThe list of variables on the left can include extra commas to skip certain values on the right\n\n`[,x,,y] = [1,2,3,4];`\n\nx == 2; y == 4\n\n**Note**: the last comma does not stand for a value.\n\nTo collect all unused or remaining values into a single variable when destructuring an array, use three dots `(...)`before the last variable name on the left-hand side\n\n`let [x, ...y] = [1,2,3,4];`\n\ny == \\[2,3,4\\]\n\n`let [first, ...rest] = \"Hello\";`\n\nfirst == \"H\"; rest ==\\[\"e\",\"l\",\"l\",\"o\"\\]\n\nDestructuring assignment can also be performed when the righthand side is an object value.\n\n`let transparent = {r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0};`\n\n`let {r, g, b} = transparent;`\n\nr == 0.0; g == 0.0; b == 0.0\n\n`const {sin, cos, tan} = Math;`\n\nsin=Math.sin, cos=Math.cos, tan=Math.tan\n\n### Expressions and Operators\n\nIn JavaScript, the values `null`and `undefined`are the only two values that do not have properties. In a regular property access expression using . or \\[\\], you get a `TypeError` if the expression on the left evaluates to `null`or `undefined`. You can use `?.` and `?.[]` syntax to guard against errors of this type.\n\nYou can also invoke a function using `?.()` instead of `()`.\n\nWith the `new ?.()` invocation syntax, if the expression to the left of the `?.` evaluates to `null` or `undefined`, then the entire invocation expression evaluates to `undefined`and no exception is thrown.\n\nWrite the function invocation using `?.(),` knowing that invocation will only happen if there is actually a value to be invoked\n\n    function square(x, log) {\n\n    log?.(x); // Call the function if there is one\n\n    return x * x;\n\n    }\n\nNote that expression `x++` is not always the same as `x = x + 1`.The `++` operator never performs string concatenation: it always converts its operand to a number and increments it. If x is the string \"1\", `++x` is the number 2, but`x + 1` is the string \"11\".\n\nJavaScript objects are compared by reference, not by value. An object is equal to itself, but not to any other object. If two distinct objects have the same number of properties, with the same names and values, they are still not equal. Similarly, two arrays that have the same elements in the same order are not equal to each other.\n\n`NaN`value is never equal to any other value, including itself! To check whether a value `x` is `NaN`, use `x !==`, or the global `isNaN()` function.\n\nIf both values refer to the same object, array, or function, they are equal. If they refer to different objects, they are not equal, even if both objects have identical properties.\n\n### Evaluating Expressions\n\nJavaScript has the ability to interpret strings of JavaScript source code, evaluating them to produce a value.\n\n`eval(\"3+2\")`\n\nBecause of security issues, some web servers use the HTTP \"Content-Security-Policy\" header to disable`eval()` for an entire website.\n\n### First-Defined (??)\n\nThe first-defined operator `??` evaluates to its first defined operand: if its left operand is not `null` and not `undefined`, it returns that value.\n\n`a ?? b` is equivalent to `(a !== null &#x26;&#x26; a !== undefined) ? a : b`\n\n`??` is a useful alternative to `||.` The problem with this idiomatic use is that zero, the empty string, and false are all `falsy`values that may be perfectly valid in some circumstances. In this code example, if `maxWidth`is zero, that value will be ignored. But if we change the `||` operator to `??`, we end up with an expression where zero is a valid value.\n\n`let max = maxWidth || preferences.maxWidth || 500;`\n\n`let max = maxWidth ?? preferences.maxWidth ?? 500;`\n\n### delete Operator\n\nDeleting an array element leaves a \"hole\" in the array and does not change the array's length. The resulting array is sparse.\n\n### void Operator\n\nUsing the `void` operator makes sense only if the operand has side effects.\n\n`let counter = 0;`\n\n`const increment = () => void counter++;`\n\n`increment()`\n\nundefined\n\n`counter`\n\n1\n\n### Statements\n\nExpressions are evaluated to produce a value, but statements are executed to make something happen.\n\nExpressions with side effects, such as assignments and function invocations, can stand alone as statements, and when used this way are known as expression statements.\n\nA similar category of statements are the declaration statements that declare new variables and define new functions.\n\nIf a function does not have any side effects, there is no sense in calling it, unless it is part of a larger expression or an assignment statement.\n\n### for/of\n\nThe `for/of` loop works with iterable objects. Arrays, strings, sets, and maps are iterable.\n\nArray\n\n    let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], sum = 0;\n\n    for(let element of data) {\n\n    sum += element;\n\n    }\n\n    let text = \"Na na na na na na na na\";\n\n    let wordSet = new Set(text.split(\" \"));\n\n    let unique = [];\n\n    for(let word of wordSet) {\n\n    unique.push(word);\n\n    }\n\nString\n\n    let frequency = {};\n\n    for(let letter of \"mississippi\") {\n\n    if (frequency[letter]) {\n\n    frequency[letter]++;\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n    frequency[letter] = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\nMap\n\n    let m = new Map([[1, \"one\"]]);\n\n    for(let [key, value] of m) {\n\n    key // => 1\n\n    value // => \"one\"\n\n    }\n\nObjects are not (by default) iterable. Attempting to use `for/of` on a regular object throws a `TypeError` at runtime.\n\nIf you want to iterate through the properties of an object, you can use the `for/in` loop.\n\nNote: `for/of` can be used on objects with `Object.entries` property, but it will not pick properties from object's prototype.\n\n### for/in\n\n`for/in` loop works with any object after the `in`.\n\n    for(let p in o) {\n\n    console.log(o[p]);\n\n    }\n\nNote: this will enumerate array indexes, not values.\n\n    for(let i in a) console.log(i);\n\nThe `for/in` loop does not actually enumerate all properties of an object. It does not enumerate properties whose names are symbols. And of the properties whose names are strings, it only loops over the `enumerable`properties.\n\n### with\n\nThe with statement runs a block of code as if the properties of a specified object were variables in scope for that code.\n\nThe `with`statement is forbidden in strict mode and should be considered deprecated in non-strict mode: avoid using it whenever possible.\n\n    document.forms[0].address.value\n\n    with(document.forms[0]) {\n\n    name.value = \"\";\n\n    address.value = \"\";\n\n    email.value = \"\";\n\n    }\n\n### debugger\n\nIf a debugger program is available and is running, then an implementation may (but is not required to) perform some kind of debugging action.\n\nIn practice, this statement acts like a breakpoint: execution of JavaScript code stops, and you can use the debugger to print variables' values, examine the call stack, and so on.\n\nNote that it is not enough to have a debugger available: the debugger statement won't start the debugger for you. If you're using a web browser and have the developer tools console open, however, this statement will cause a breakpoint.\n\n### use strict\n\nStrict mode is a restricted subset of the language that fixes important language deficiencies and provides stronger error checking and increased security.\n\nThe differences between strict mode and non-strict mode are the following:\n\n· The `with`statement is not allowed in strict mode.\n\n· In strict mode, all variables must be declared: a `ReferenceError`is thrown if you assign a value to an identifier that is not a declared variable, function, function parameter, catch clause parameter, or property of the global object.\n\n· In non-strict mode, this implicitly declares a global variable by adding a new property to the global object.\n\n· In strict mode, functions invoked as functions (rather than as methods) have a `this`value of undefined. (In non-strict mode, functions invoked as functions are always passed the global object as their `this`value.)\n\n· A function is invoked with `call()`or `apply()` , the `this`value is exactly the value passed as the first argument to `call()` or `apply()`. (In non-strict mode, `null`and `undefined`values are replaced with the global object and non-object values are converted to objects.)\n\n· In strict mode, assignments to non-writable properties and attempts to create new properties on non-extensible objects throw a `TypeError`. (In non-strict mode, these attempts fail silently.)\n\n· In strict mode, code passed to `eval()`cannot declare variables or define functions in the caller's scope as it can in non-strict mode. Instead, variable and function definitions live in a new scope created for the `eval()`. This scope is discarded when the `eval()` returns.\n\n· In strict mode, the Arguments object in a function holds a static copy of the values passed to the function. In non-strict mode, the Arguments object has \"magical\" behavior in which elements of the array and named function parameters both refer to the same value.\n\n· In strict mode, a `SyntaxError`is thrown if the `delete`operator is followed by an unqualified identifier such as a variable, function, or function parameter. (In non-strict mode, such a `delete`expression does nothing and evaluates to false.)\n\n· In strict mode, an attempt to delete a non-configurable property throws a `TypeError`. (In non-strict mode, the attempt fails and the delete expression evaluates to false.)\n\n· In strict mode, it is a syntax error for an object literal to define two or more properties by the same name. (In non-strict mode, no error occurs.)\n\n### Objects\n\nIn addition to its name and value, each property has three property attributes:\n\n· The `writable`attribute specifies whether the value of the property can be set.\n\n· The `enumerable`attribute specifies whether the property name is returned by a `for/in` loop.\n\n· The `configurable`attribute specifies whether the property can be deleted and whether its attributes can be altered.\n\n### Prototypes\n\nAll objects created by object literals have the same prototype object, `Object.prototype.`\n\nObjects created using the `new`keyword and a constructor invocation use the value of the prototype property of the constructor function as their prototype.\n\nObject created by `new Object()` inherits from `Object.prototype`, just as the object created by `{}` does. Similarly, the object created by `new Array()` uses `Array.prototype` as its prototype, and the object created by`new Date()` uses `Date.prototype` as its prototype.\n\nAlmost all objects have a prototype, but only a relatively small number of objects have a `prototype`property. It is these objects with prototype properties that define the prototypes for all the other objects.\n\nMost built-in constructors (and most user-defined constructors) have a prototype that inherits from `Object.prototype`.\n\n`Date.prototype` inherits properties from `Object.prototype`, so a Date object created by `new Date()` inherits properties from both `Date.prototype` and `Object.prototype`. This linked series of prototype objects is known as a prototype chain.\n\n### Creating Objects\n\nObjects can be created with object literals, with the `new` keyword, and with the `Object.create()` function.\n\nLiteral\n\n`let empty = {};`\n\n`let point = { x: 0, y: 0 };`\n\n    let book = {\n\n    \"main title\": \"JavaScript\",\n\n    \"sub-title\": \"The Definitive Guide\",\n\n    for: \"all audiences\",\n\n    author: {\n\n    firstname: \"David\", .\n\n    surname: \"Flanagan\"\n\n    }\n\n    };\n\n`new`\n\n`let o = new Object();`\n`let a = new Array();`\n`let d = new Date();`\n`let r = new Map();`\n\n`Object.create`\n\n`let o3 = Object.create(Object.prototype);`\n\nUse `Object.create` to guard against accidental modifications:\n\n    let o = { x: \"don't change this value\" };\n\n    library.function(Object.create(o));\n\nNote: the library function can modify the passed in object, but not the original `o` object\n\n### Access Object Properties with an array (\\[\\]) notation\n\n    let addr = \"\";\n\n    for(let i = 0; i &#x3C; 4; i++) {\n\n    addr += customer[`address${i}`] + \"\\n\";\n\n    }\n\n### Inheritance\n\n`let o = {};`\n\n`o.x = 1;`\n\n`let p = Object.create(o);`\n\n`p.y = 2;`\n\n`let q = Object.create(p);`\n\n`q.z = 3;`\n\nProperty `x` and `y` available on object `q`\n\n`q.x + q.y`\n\n### How to query for property which may be undefined\n\n`surname = book &#x26;&#x26; book.author &#x26;&#x26; book.author.surname;`\n\n`let surname = book?.author?.surname;`\n\n### Deleting properties\n\nThe `delete` operator only deletes own properties, not inherited ones. (To delete an inherited property, you must delete it from the prototype object in which it is defined. Doing this affects every object that inherits from that prototype.)\n\n`delete` does not remove properties that have a `configurable`attribute of false.\n\nCertain properties of built-in objects are non-configurable, as are properties of the global object created by variable declaration and function declaration.\n\n`delete Object.prototype`\n\nfalse: property is non-configurable\n\n`var x = 1;`\n\n`delete globalThis.x`\n\nfalse: can't delete `this`property\n\n`function f() {}`\n\n`delete globalThis.f`\n\nfalse\n\n`globalThis.x = 1;`\n\n`delete globalThis.x`\n\ntrue\n\n### Testing properties\n\nTo check whether an object has a property with a given name. You can do this with the `in` operator, with the `hasOwnProperty()` and `propertyIsEnumerable()` methods, or simply by querying the property\n\n( `!= undefined`).\n\n### in &#x26; query\n\n`let o = { x: 1 };`\n\n`\"x\" in o`\n\ntrue\n\n`o.x !== undefined`\n\n`\"y\" in o`\n\nfalse\n\n`o.y !== undefined`\n\n`\"toString\" in o`\n\ntrue: o inherits a `toString`property\n\n`o.toString !== undefined`\n\nAdvantage of using in: `in` can distinguish between properties that do not exist and properties that exist but have been set to `undefined`.\n\n### hasOwnProperty\n\n`let o = { x: 1 };`\n\n`o.hasOwnProperty(\"x\")`\n\ntrue\n\n`o.hasOwnProperty(\"y\")`\n\nfalse\n\n`o.hasOwnProperty(\"toString\")`\n\nfalse: toString is an inherited property\n\nThe `propertyIsEnumerable()` returns true only if the named property is an own property and its `enumerable` attribute is true.\n\n`let o = { x: 1 };`\n\n`o.propertyIsEnumerable(\"x\")`\n\ntrue\n\n`o.propertyIsEnumerable(\"toString\")`\n\nfalse: not an own property\n\n`Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable(\"toString\")`\n\nfalse: not enumerable\n\n### Enumerating properties\n\nTo guard against enumerating inherited properties with `for/in`, you can add an explicit check inside the loop body:\n\n    for(let p in o) {\n\n    if (!o.hasOwnProperty(p)) continue;\n\n    }\n\n    for(let p in o) {\n\n    if (typeof o[p] === \"function\") continue;\n\n    }\n\nFunctions you can use to get an array of property names\n\n· `Object.keys()` returns an array of the names of the enumerable own properties of an object. It does not include non-enumerable properties, inherited properties, or properties whose name is a Symbol.\n\n· `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` works like `Object.keys()`but returns an array of the names of nonenumerable own properties as well.\n\n· `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` returns own properties whose names are Symbols, whether or not they are enumerable.\n\n· `Reflect.ownKeys()` returns all own property names, both enumerable and non-enumerable, and both string and Symbol.\n\n### Extending Objects\n\nTo copy the properties of one object to another object\n\n    let target = {x: 1}, source = {y: 2, z: 3};\n\n    for(let key of Object.keys(source)) {\n\n    target[key] = source[key];\n\n    }\n\nOne reason to assign properties from one object into another is when you have an object that defines default values for many properties and you want to copy those default properties into another object if a property by that name does not already exist in that object. Using `Object.assign()` naively will not do what you want:\n\n    Object.assign(o, defaults);\n\noverwrites everything in o with defaults\n\nInstead, use one of the following:,\n\n`o = Object.assign({}, defaults, o);`\n\n`o = {...defaults, ...o};`\n\n### Serializing Objects\n\nThe functions `JSON.stringify()` and`JSON.parse()` serialize and restore JavaScript objects.\n\n`let o = {x: 1, y: {z: [false, null, \"\"]}};`\n\n`let s = JSON.stringify(o);`\n\ns == '{\"x\":1,\"y\":{\"z\":\\[false,null,\"\"\\]}}'\n\n`let p = JSON.parse(s);`\n\np == {x: 1, y: {z: \\[false,null, \"\"\\]}}\n\n### Object methods\n\n`toString(), valueOf(), loLocaleString(), toJSON()`\n\n`let s = { x: 1, y: 1 }.toString();`\n\ns == \"\\[object Object\\]\"\n\n### Extended Object Literal Syntax\n\n### Shorthand Properties\n\n    let x = 1, y = 2;\n\n    let o = {\n\n    x: x,\n\n    y: y\n\n    };\n\n←&#x26;gt;\n\n`let x = 1, y = 2;`\n`let o = { x, y };`\n\n### Computer Property Names\n\n`const PROPERTY_NAME = \"p1\";`\n`function computePropertyName() { return \"p\" + 2; }`\n\n    let o = {};\n\n    o[PROPERTY_NAME] = 1;\n\n    o[computePropertyName()] = 2;\n\n←&#x26;gt;\n\n    let p = {\n\n    [PROPERTY_NAME]: 1,\n\n    [computePropertyName()]: 2\n\n    };\n\n### Symbols as Property Names\n\n    const extension = Symbol(\"my extension symbol\");\n\n    let o = {\n\n    [extension]: {}\n\n    };\n\n    o[extension].x = 0;\n\nTwo Symbols created with the same string argument are still different from one another.\n\nThe point of Symbols is not security, but to define a safe extension mechanism for JavaScript objects. If you get an object from third-party code that you do not control and need to add some of your own properties to that object but want to be sure that your properties will not conflict with any properties that may already exist on the object, you can safely use Symbols as your property names.\n\n### Spread Operator\n\nYou can copy the properties of an existing object into a new object using the \"spread operator\" … inside an object literal:\n\n`let position = { x: 0, y: 0 };`\n`let dimensions = { width: 100, height: 75 };`\n`let rect = { ...position, ...dimensions };`\n`rect.x + rect.y + rect.width + rect.height`\n\n### Shorthand Methods\n\n    let square = {\n\n    area: function() {\n\n    return this.side * this.side; },\n\n    side: 10\n\n    };\n\n←&#x26;gt;\n\n    let square = {\n\n    area() {\n\n    return this.side * this.side; },\n\n    side: 10\n\n    };\n\nWhen you write a method using this shorthand syntax, the property name can take any of the forms that are legal in an object literal: in addition to a regular JavaScript identifier like the name area above, you can also use string literals and computed property names, which can include Symbol property names:\n\n    const METHOD_NAME = \"m\";\n\n    const symbol = Symbol();\n\n    let weirdMethods = {\n\n    \"method With Spaces\"(x) { return x + 1; },\n\n    [METHOD_NAME](x) { return x + 2; },\n\n    [symbol](x) { return x + 3; }\n\n    };\n\n`weirdMethods[\"method With Spaces\"](1)`\n\n2\n\n`weirdMethods[METHOD_NAME](1)`\n\n3\n\n`weirdMethods[symbol](1)`\n\n4\n\n### Property Getters and Setters\n\n    let o = {\n\n    dataProp: value,\n\n    get accessorProp() { return this.dataProp; },\n\n    set accessorProp(value) { this.dataProp = value; }\n\n    };\n\n### Arrays\n\n### Creating Arrays\n\n· Array literals\n\n· The … spread operator on an iterable object\n\n· The `Array()` constructor\n\n· The `Array.of()` and `Array.from()` factory methods\n\n### Array literals\n\n`let empty = [];`\n\n`let primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];`\n\n`let misc = [ 1.1, true, \"a\", ];`\n\n`let b = [[1, {x: 1, y: 2}], [2, {x: 3, y: 4}]];`\n\nIf an array literal contains multiple commas in a row, with no value between, the array is sparse\n\n`let count = [1,,3];`\n\n`let undefs = [,,];`\n\nArray literal syntax allows an optional trailing comma, so `[,,]` has a length of 2, not 3.\n\n### The Spread Operator\n\n`let a = [1, 2, 3];`\n\n`let b = [0, ...a, 4];`\n\n\\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\]\n\ncreate a copy of an array — modifying the copy does not change the original\n\n`let original = [1,2,3];`\n`let copy = [...original];`\n\n`let digits = [...\"0123456789ABCDEF\"];`\n\n\\[\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\",\"F\"\\]\n\n`let letters = [...\"hello world\"];`\n\n\\[\"h\",\"e\",\"l\",\"l\"\"o\",\"\",\"w\",\"o\"\"r\",\"l\",\"d\"\\]\n\n`[...new Set(letters)]`\n\n\\[\"h\",\"e\",\"l\",\"o\",\"\",\"w\",\"r\",\"d\"\\]\n\n### Array.of()\n\nWhen the `Array()` constructor function is invoked with one numeric argument, it uses that argument as an array length. But when invoked with more than one numeric argument, it treats those arguments as elements for the array to be created. This means that the `Array()` constructor cannot be used to create an array with a single numeric element.\n\n`Array.of()`\n\n\\[\\]\n\n`Array.of(10)`\n\n\\[10\\]\n\n`Array.of(1,2,3)`\n\n\\[1, 2, 3\\]\n\n### Array.from()\n\nIt is also a simple way to make a copy of an array:\n\n`let copy = Array.from(original);`\n\n`Array.from()` is also important because it defines a way to make a true-array copy of an array-like object. Array-like objects are non-array objects that have a numeric length property and have values stored with properties whose names happen to be integers.\n\n`let truearray = Array.from(arraylike);`\n\n`Array.from()` also accepts an optional second argument. If you pass a function as the second argument, then as the new array is being built, each element from the source object will be passed to the function you specify, and the return value of the function will be stored in the array instead of the original value.\n\n### Reading and Writing Array Elements\n\nWhat is special about arrays is that when you use property names that are non-negative integers , the array automatically maintains the value of the `length` property for you.\n\nJavaScript converts the numeric array index you specify to a string — the index 1 becomes the string \"1\", then uses that string as a property name.\n\nIt is helpful to clearly distinguish an array index from an object property name. All indexes are property names, but only property names that are integers between 0 and 231 are indexes. All arrays are objects, and you can create properties of any name on them. If you use properties that are array indexes, however, arrays have the special behavior of updating their `length` property as needed.\n\nNote that you can index an array using numbers that are negative or that are not integers. When you do this, the number is converted to a string, and that string is used as the property name. Since the name is not a non-negative integer, it is treated as a regular object property, not an array index.\n\n`a[-1.23] = true;`\n\nThis creates a property named \"-1.23\"\n\n`a[\"1000\"] = 0;`\n\nThis the 1001st element of the array\n\n`a[1.000] = 1;`\n\nArray index 1. Same as a\\[1\\] = 1;\n\nThe fact that array indexes are simply a special type of object property name means that JavaScript arrays have no notion of an \"out of bounds\" error. When you try to query a nonexistent property of any object, you don't get an error; you simply get `undefined`.\n\n### Sparse Arrays\n\nSparse arrays can be created with the `Array()` constructor or simply by assigning to an array index larger than the current array length.\n\n`a[1000] = 0;`\n\nAssignment adds one element but sets length to 1001.\n\nyou can also make an array sparse with the `delete` operator.\n\nNote that when you omit a value in an array literal (using repeated commas as in `[1,,3]`), the resulting array is sparse, and the omitted elements simply do not exist\n\n### Array Length\n\nif you set the length property to a nonnegative integer `n` smaller than its current value, any array elements whose index is greater than or equal to n are deleted from the array.\n\n`a = [1,2,3,4,5];`\n\n`a.length = 3;`\n\na is now \\[1,2,3\\].\n\n`a.length = 0;`\n\nDelete all elements. a is \\[\\].\n\n`a.length = 5;`\n\nLength is 5, but no elements, like `new Array(5)`\n\nYou can also set the length property of an array to a value larger than its current value. Doing this does not actually add any new elements to the array; it simply creates a sparse area at the end of the array.\n\n### Adding and Deleting Array Elements\n\n`let a = [];`\n\n`a[0] = \"zero\";`\n\n`a[1] = \"one\";`\n\nadd elements to it.\n\nYou can also use the `push()` method to add one or more values to the end of an array.\n\nYou can use the`unshift()` method to insert a value at the beginning of an array, shifting the existing array elements to higher indexes.\n\nThe `pop()` method is the opposite of `push()`: it removes the last element of the array and returns it, reducing the length of an array by 1.\n\nSimilarly, the `shift()` method removes and returns the first element of the array, reducing the length by 1 and shifting all elements down to an index one lower than their current index.\n\nYou can delete array elements with the delete operator\n\n`let a = [1,2,3];`\n\n`delete a[2];`\n\na now has no element at index 2\n\n`2 in a`\n\nfalse\n\n`a.length`\n\n3: delete does not affect array length\n\n### Iterating Arrays\n\nThe easiest way to loop through each of the elements of an array (or any iterable object) is with the `for/of`loop\n\n    let letters = [...\"Hello world\"];\n\n    let string = \"\";\n\n    for(let letter of letters) {\n\n    string += letter;\n\n    }\n\nIt has no special behavior for sparse arrays and simply returns `undefined` for any array elements that do not exist.\n\nIf you want to use a `for/of` loop for an array and need to know the index of each array element, use the `entries()` method of the array\n\n    let letters = [...\"Hello world\"];\n\n    let everyother = \"\";\n\n    for(let [index, letter] of letters.entries()) {\n\n    if (index % 2 === 0) everyother += letter;\n\n    }\n\nAnother good way to iterate arrays is with `forEach()`. This is not a new form of the for loop, but an array method that offers a functional approach to array iteration.\n\n    let letters = [...\"Hello world\"];\n\n    let uppercase = \"\";\n\n    letters.forEach(letter => {\n\n    uppercase += letter.toUpperCase();\n\n    });\n\nYou can also loop through the elements of an array with a `for` loop.\n\n    for(let i = 0, len = letters.length; i &#x3C; len; i++) {\n\n    // loop body\n\n    }\n\n### Multidimensional Arrays\n\n### Create a multidimensional array\n\n`let table = new Array(10);`\n\n    for(let i = 0; i &#x3C; table.length; i++) {\n\n    table[i] = new Array(10);\n\n    }\n\n    for(let row = 0; row &#x3C; table.length; row++) {\n\n    for(let col = 0; col &#x3C; table[row].length; col++) {\n\n    table[row][col] = row * col;\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n### Array Methods\n\n### Array Iterator Methods\n\nFirst, all of these methods accept a function as their first argument and invoke that function once for each element (or some elements) of the array. If the array is sparse, the function you pass is not invoked for nonexistent elements. In most cases, the function you supply is invoked with three arguments: the value of the array element, the index of the array element, and the array itself.\n\nFOREACH()\n\n`let data = [1,2,3,4,5], sum = 0;`\n\n    data.forEach(value => { sum += value; });\n\n    data.forEach(function(v, i, a) {\n\n    a[i] = v + 1;\n\n    });\n\n15\n\n\\[2,3,4,5,6\\]\n\nMAP()\n\n`let a = [1, 2, 3];`\n`a.map(x => x*x)`\n\n\\[1, 4, 9\\]\n\nFILTER()\n\n`let a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];`\n`a.filter(x => x &#x3C; 3)`\n`a.filter((x,i) => i % 2 === 0)`\n\n\\[2, 1\\];\n\n\\[5, 3, 1\\];\n\nFIND()\n\nFINDINDEX()\n\n`let a = [1,2,3,4,5];`\n\n`a.findIndex(x => x === 3)`\n\n`a.find(x => x % 5 === 0)`\n\n`a.find(x => x % 7 === 0)`\n\n2\n\n5\n\nundefined\n\nEVERY()\n\nSOME()\n\n`let a = [1,2,3,4,5];`\n\n`a.every(x => x &#x3C; 10)`\n\n`a.some(x => x % 2 === 0)`\n\n`a.some(isNaN)`\n\ntrue\n\ntrue\n\nfalse\n\nREDUCE()\n\nReduceRight()\n\nl`et a = [1,2,3,4,5];`\n\n`a.reduce((x,y) => x+y, 0)`\n\n`a.reduce((x,y) => x*y, 1)`\n\n`a.reduce((x,y) => (x > y) ? x : y)`\n\n15\n\n120\n\n5\n\nNote that `map()` returns a new array: it does not modify the array it is invoked on. If that array is sparse, your function will not be called for the missing elements, but the returned array will be sparse in the same way as the original array: it will have the same length and the same missing elements.\n\nTo close the gaps in a sparse array, you can do this:\n\n`let dense = sparse.filter(() => true);`\n\nAnd to close gaps and remove undefined and null elements, you can use filter, like this:\n\n`a = a.filter(x => x !== undefined &#x26;&#x26; x !== null);`\n\nUnlike `filter()`, however,`find()` and `findIndex()` stop iterating the first time the predicate finds an element. When that happens, `find()` returns the matching element, and `findIndex()` returns the index of the matching element. If no matching element is found,`find()` returns `undefined` and`findIndex()`returns -1.\n\nWhen you invoke `reduce()` with no initial value, it uses the first element of the array as the initial value.\n\n`reduceRight()` works just like `reduce()`, except that it processes the array from highest index to lowest (right-to-left), rather than from lowest to highest. You might want to do this if the reduction operation has right-to-left associativity\n\n### Flattening arrays with `flat()` and `flatMap()`\n\n`[1, [2, 3]].flat()`\n\n\\[1, 2, 3\\]\n\n`[1, [2, [3]]].flat()`\n\n\\[1, 2, \\[3\\]\\]\n\n`let a = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]];`\n\n`a.flat(1)`\n\n`a.flat(2)`\n\n`a.flat(3)`\n\n`a.flat(4)`\n\n\\[1, 2, \\[3, \\[4\\]\\]\\]\n\n\\[1, 2, 3, \\[4\\]\\]\n\n\\[1, 2, 3, 4\\]\n\n\\[1, 2, 3, 4\\]\n\n`let phrases = [\"hello world\", \"the definitive guide\"];`\n`let words = phrases.flatMap(phrase => phrase.split(\" \"));`\n\n\\[\"hello\", \"world\", \"the\", \"definitive\", \"guide\"\\];\n\nCalling `a.flatMap(f)` is the same as (but more efficient than) `a.map(f).flat()`:\n\n### Adding arrays with concat()\n\n`let a = [1,2,3];`\n\n`a.concat(4, 5)`\n\n\\[1,2,3,4,5\\]\n\n`a.concat([4,5],[6,7])`\n\n\\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\]\n\n### Stacks and Queues with push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift()\n\nThe `push()` and`pop()` methods allow you to work with arrays as if they were stacks. The `push()` method appends one or more new elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.\n\nThe `unshift()` and `shift()` methods behave much like `push()` and`pop()`, except that they insert and remove elements from the beginning of an array rather than from the end.\n\nYou can implement a queue data structure by using `push()` to add elements at the end of an array and `shift()` to remove them from the start of the array. Note differences in `unshift`with single and multiple values.\n\n`let a = [];`\n\n`a.unshift(1)`\n\n\\[1\\]\n\n`a.unshift(2)`\n\n\\[2, 1\\]\n\n`a = [];`\n\n`a.unshift(1,2)`\n\n\\[1, 2\\]\n\n### Subarrays with `slice(), splice(), fill()`, and `copyWithin()`\n\nSLICE()\n\n`let a = [1,2,3,4,5];`\n\n`a.slice(0,3);`\n\n`a.slice(3);`\n\n`a.slice(1,-1);`\n\n`a.slice(-3,-2);`\n\n\\[1,2,3\\]\n\n\\[4,5\\]\n\n\\[2,3,4\\]\n\n\\[3\\]\n\nSPLICE\n\n`let a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];`\n\n`a.splice(4)`\n\n`a.splice(1,2)`\n\n`a.splice(1,1)`\n\n`let a = [1,2,3,4,5];`\n\n`a.splice(2,0,\"a\",\"b\")`\n\n`a.splice(2,2,[1,2],3)`\n\n\\[5,6,7,8\\]; `a` is now \\[1,2,3,4\\]\n\n\\[2,3\\]; a is now \\[1,4\\]\n\n\\[4\\]; a is now \\[1\\]\n\n\\[\\]; a is now \\[1,2,\"a\",\"b\",3,4,5\\]\n\n\\[\"a\",\"b\"\\]; a is now \\[1,2,\\[1,2\\],3,3,4,5\\]\n\nFILL()\n\n`let a = new Array(5);`\n\n`a.fill(0)`\n\n`a.fill(9, 1)`\n\n`a.fill(8, 2, -1)`\n\n\\[0,0,0,0,0\\]\n\n\\[0,9,9,9,9\\]\n\n\\[0,9,8,8,9\\]\n\nCOPYWITHIN()\n\n`let a = [1,2,3,4,5];`\n\n`a.copyWithin(1)`\n\n`a.copyWithin(2, 3, 5)`\n\n`a.copyWithin(0, -2)`\n\n\\[1,1,2,3,4\\]\n\n\\[1,1,3,4,4\\]\n\n\\[4,4,3,4,4\\]\n\n`splice()` is a general-purpose method for inserting or removing elements from an array.`splice()` can delete elements from an array, insert new elements into an array, or perform both operations at the same time.\n\nThe first argument to `splice()` specifies the array position at which the insertion and/or deletion is to begin. The second argument specifies the number of elements that should be deleted from (spliced out of) the array.\n\nUnlike `concat(), splice()` inserts arrays themselves, not the elements of those arrays.\n\n`copyWithin()` copies a slice of an array to a new position within the array. It modifies the array in place and returns the modified array, but it will not change the length of the array.\n\n### Array Searching and Sorting Methods\n\nINDEXOF()\nLASTINDEXOF()\n\n`let a = [0,1,2,1,0];`\n\n`a.indexOf(1)`\n\n`a.lastIndexOf(1)`\n\n`a.indexOf(3)`\n\n1\n\n3\n\n-1\n\nSORT()\n\n`let a = [33, 4, 1111, 222];`\n\n`a.sort();`\n\n`a.sort((a,b) => a - b);`\n\nCase-insensitive sort\n\n    let a = [\"ant\", \"Bug\", \"cat\", \"Dog\"];\n\n    a.sort(); // a == [\"Bug\",\"Dog\",\"ant\",\"cat\"];\n\n    a.sort(function(s,t) {\n\n    let a = s.toLowerCase();\n\n    let b = t.toLowerCase();\n\n    if (a &#x3C; b) return -1;\n\n    if (a > b) return 1;\n\n    return 0;\n\n    });\n\n`[1111, 222, 33, 4];`\n\n`[4, 33, 222, 1111]`\n\nREVERSE()\n\n`let a = [1,2,3];`\n`a.reverse();`\n\n\\[3,2,1\\]\n\n`indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()` compare their argument to the array elements using the equivalent of the === operator. If your array contains objects instead of primitive values, these methods check to see if two references both refer to exactly the same object. If you want to actually look at the content of an object, try using the `find()` method with your own custom predicate function instead.\n\n`indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()` take an optional second argument that specifies the array index at which to begin the search. Negative values are allowed for the second argument and are treated as an offset from the end of the array.\n\n`indexOf()` will not detect the NaN value in an array, but `includes()` will\n\nWhen `sort()` is called with no arguments, it sorts the array elements in alphabetical order. To sort an array into some order other than alphabetical, you must pass a comparison function as an argument to `sort()`.\n\n### Array to String Conversions\n\nThe `join()` method converts all the elements of an array to strings and concatenates them, returning the resulting string.\n\n`let a = [1, 2, 3];`\n\n`a.join()`\n\n`a.join(\" \")`\n\n`a.join(\"\")`\n\n\"1,2,3\"\n\n\"1 2 3\"\n\n\"123\"\n\n`let b = new Array(10);`\n\n`b.join(\"-\")`\n\n\" — — — — -\"\n\nArrays, like all JavaScript objects, have a `toString()` method. For an array, this method works just like the `join()` method with no arguments:\n\n`[1,2,3].toString()`\n\n\"1,2,3\"\n\n`[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].toString()`\n\n\"a,b,c\"\n\n`[1, [2,\"c\"]].toString()`\n\n\"1,2,c\"\n\n### Static Array Functions\n\n`Array.isArray([])`\n\ntrue\n\n`Array.isArray({})`\n\nfalse\n\n### Array-Like Objects\n\nIt is often perfectly reasonable to treat any object with a numeric `length` property and corresponding non-negative integer properties as a kind of array.\n\n    let a = {};\n\n    let i = 0;\n\n    while(i &#x3C; 10) {\n\n    a[i] = i * i;\n\n    i++;\n\n    }\n\n    a.length = i;\n\n    // Now iterate through it as if it were a real array\n\n    let total = 0;\n\n    for(let j = 0; j &#x3C; a.length; j++) {\n\n    total += a[j];\n\n    }\n\nSince array-like objects do not inherit from `Array.prototype`, you cannot invoke array methods on them directly. You can invoke them indirectly using the `Function.call` method.\n\n`let a = {\"0\": \"a\", \"1\": \"b\", \"2\": \"c\", length: 3};`\n\n// An array-like object\n\n`Array.prototype.join.call(a, \"+\")`\n\n\"a+b+c\"\n\n`Array.prototype.join.call(\"JavaScript\", \" \")`\n\n\"J a v a S c r i p t\"\n\n`Array.prototype.map.call(a, x => x.toUpperCase())`\n\n\\[\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"\\]\n\n`Array.from(a)`\n\n\\[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"\\]\n\n### Strings as Arrays\n\n`let s = \"test\";`\n\n`s.charAt(0)`\n\nt\n\n`s[1]`\n\ne\n\n### Functions\n\nIn addition to the arguments, each invocation has another value — the invocation context — that is the value of the `this` keyword.\n\n### Function Declarations\n\n    function printprops(o) {\n\n    for(let p in o) {\n\n    console.log(`${p}: ${o[p]}\\n`);\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\nFunction declaration statements are \"hoisted\" to the top of the enclosing script, function, or block so that functions defined in this way may be invoked from code that appears before the definition.\n\n### Function Expressions\n\n`const square = function(x) { return x*x; };`\n\n    const f = function fact(x) {\n\n    if (x &#x3C;= 1) return 1;\n\n    return x * fact(x-1);\n\n    }\n\nFunction expressions can include names, which is useful for recursion\n\n`[3,2,1].sort(function(a,b) { return a - b; });`\n\nFunction expressions can also be used as arguments to other functions\n\n`let tensquared = (function(x) {return x*x;}(10));`\n\nFunction expressions are sometimes defined and immediately invoked\n\n### Arrow Functions\n\n`const sum = (x, y) => { return x + y; };`\n\n`const sum = (x, y) => x + y;`\n\nno need for `return`\n\n`const polynomial = x => x*x + 2*x + 3;`\n\nomit parens with single parameter\n\n`const constantFunc = () => 42;`\n\nusage for no params\n\nIf the body of your arrow function is a single return statement but the expression to be returned is an object literal, then you have to put the object literal inside parentheses to avoid syntactic ambiguity between the curly braces of a function body and the curly braces of an object literal\n\n`const f = x => { return { value: x }; };`\n\ngood\n\n`const g = x => ({ value: x });`\n\ngood\n\n`const h = x => { value: x };`\n\nreturns nothing\n\n`const i = x => { v: x, w: x };`\n\nsyntax error\n\nArrow functions differ from functions defined in other ways in one critical way: they inherit the value of the `this` keyword from the environment in which they are defined rather than defining their own invocation context as functions defined in other ways do.\n\n### Nested Functions\n\n    function hypotenuse(a, b) {\n\n    function square(x) { return x*x; }\n\n    return Math.sqrt(square(a) + square(b));\n\n    }\n\n### Invoking Functions\n\nFor function invocation in non-strict mode, the invocation context (the `this` value) is the global object. In strict mode, however, the invocation context is `undefined`.\n\n`const strict = (function() { return !this; }())`\n\nDetermine if we're in strict mode\n\n### Constructor Invocation\n\nA constructor invocation creates a new, empty object that inherits from the object specified by the `prototype`property of the constructor.\n\n### Indirect invocation\n\nJavaScript functions are objects, and like all JavaScript objects, they have methods. Two of these methods, `call()` and `apply()`, invoke the function indirectly. Both methods allow you to explicitly specify the `this`value for the invocation, which means you can invoke any function as a method of any object, even if it is not actually a method of that object.\n\n### Function Arguments and Parameters\n\n### Optional Parameters and Defaults\n\nWhen a function is invoked with fewer arguments than declared parameters, the additional parameters are set to their default value, which is normally `undefined`.\n\n    function getPropertyNames(o, a) {\n\n    a = a || [];\n\n    for(let property in o) a.push(property);\n\n    return a;\n\n    }\n\n    function getPropertyNames(o, a = []) {\n\n    for(let property in o) a.push(property);\n\n    return a;\n\n    }\n\nOne interesting case is that, for functions with multiple parameters, you can use the value of a previous parameter to define the default value of the parameters that follow it\n\n    const rectangle = (width, height = width*2) => ({width, height});\n\n### Rest Parameters and Variable-Length Argument Lists\n\nRest parameters enable us to write functions that can be invoked with arbitrarily more arguments than parameters.\n\n    function max(first=-Infinity, ...rest) {\n\n    let maxValue = first;\n\n    for(let n of rest) {\n\n    if (n > maxValue) {\n\n    maxValue = n;\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    return maxValue;\n\n    }\n\n    max(1, 10, 100, 2, 3, 1000, 4, 5, 6)\n\n1000\n\nwithin the body of a function, the value of a rest parameter will always be an array. The array may be empty, but a rest parameter will never be `undefined`.\n\nThis type of function is called variadic functions, variable arity functions, or vararg functions.\n\n### The Arguments Object\n\nWithin the body of any function, the identifier `arguments` refers to the Arguments object for that invocation.\n\n    function max(x) {\n\n    let maxValue = -Infinity;\n\n    for(let i = 0; i &#x3C; arguments.length; i++) {\n\n    if (arguments[i] > maxValue)\n\n    maxValue = arguments[i];\n\n    }\n\n    return maxValue;\n\n    }\n\n    max(1, 10, 100, 2, 3, 1000, 4, 5, 6)\n\n1000\n\nyou should avoid using it in any new code you write.\n\n### The Spread Operator for Function Calls\n\n    let numbers = [5, 2, 10, -1, 9, 100, 1];\n\n    Math.min(...numbers)\n\n-1\n\n    function timed(f) {\n\n    return function(...args) {\n\n    console.log(`Entering function ${f.name}`);\n\n    let startTime = Date.now();\n\n    try {\n\n    return f(...args);\n\n    }\n\n    finally {\n\n    console.log(`Exiting ${f.name} after ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);\n\n    }\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n    // Compute the sum of the numbers between 1 and n by brute force\n\n    function benchmark(n) {\n\n    let sum = 0;\n\n    for(let i = 1; i &#x3C;= n; i++) sum += i;\n\n    return sum;\n\n    }\n\n    // Now invoke the timed version of that test function\n\n    timed(benchmark)(1000000)\n\n### Destructuring Function Arguments into Parameters\n\n    function vectorAdd(v1, v2) {\n\n    return [v1[0] + v2[0], v1[1] + v2[1]];\n\n    }\n\n    vectorAdd([1,2], [3,4])\n\n←&#x26;gt;\n\n    function vectorAdd([x1,y1], [x2,y2]) {\n\n    return [x1 + x2, y1 + y2];\n\n    }\n\n    vectorAdd([1,2], [3,4])\n\n    function vectorMultiply({x, y}, scalar) {\n\n    return { x: x*scalar, y: y*scalar };\n\n    }\n\n    vectorMultiply({x: 1, y: 2}, 2)\n\n←&#x26;gt;\n\n    function vectorMultiply({x,y}, scalar) {\n\n    return { x: x*scalar, y: y*scalar};\n\n    }\n\n    vectorMultiply({x: 1, y: 2}, 2)\n\n### Argument Types\n\nAdding code to check the types of arguments\n\n    function sum(a) {\n\n    let total = 0;\n\n    for(let element of a) {\n\n    if (typeof element !== \"number\") {\n\n    throw new TypeError(\"sum(): elements must be numbers\");\n\n    }\n\n    total += element;\n\n    }\n\n    return total;\n\n    }\n\n`sum([1,2,3])`\n\n6\n\n`sum(1, 2, 3);`\n\n`TypeError`: 1 is not iterable\n\n`sum([1,2,\"3\"]);`\n\n`TypeError`: element 2 is not a number\n\n### Functions as Values\n\n    function square(x) { return x * x; }\n\n`let s = square;`\n\n`square(4)`\n\n16\n\n`s(4)`\n\n16\n\nFunctions can also be assigned to object properties rather than variables.\n\n`let o = {square: function(x) { return x*x; }};`\n\n`let y = o.square(16);`\n\n256\n\nFunctions don't even require names at all, as when they're assigned to array elements:\n\n`let a = [x => x*x, 20];`\n\n`a[0](a[1])`\n\n400\n\n`a[0]` accesses first element of the array, which is \"`x => x*x`\", `(a[1])` passes parameter, which is 20.\n\n### Examples of using functions as data\n\n    function add(x,y) { return x + y; }\n\n    function subtract(x,y) { return x - y; }\n\n    function multiply(x,y) { return x * y; }\n\n    function divide(x,y) { return x / y; }\n\n    function operate(operator, operand1, operand2) {\n\n    return operator(operand1, operand2);\n\n    }\n\n`let i = operate(add, operate(add, 2, 3), operate(multiply, 4,5));`\n\n`(2+3) + (4*5):`\n\nor:\n\n    const operators = {\n\n    add: (x,y) => x+y,\n\n    subtract: (x,y) => x-y,\n\n    multiply: (x,y) => x*y,\n\n    divide: (x,y) => x/y,\n\n    pow: Math.pow\n\n    };\n\n    function operate2(operation, operand1, operand2) {\n\n    if (typeof operators[operation] === \"function\") {\n\n    return operators[operation](operand1, operand2);\n\n    }\n\n    else throw \"unknown operator\";\n\n    }\n\n`operate2(\"add\", \"hello\", operate2(\"add\", \" \", \"world\"))`\n\n// \"hello world\"\n\n`operate2(\"pow\", 10, 2)`\n\n100\n\n### Defining Your Own Function Properties\n\nWhen a function needs a \"static\" variable whose value persists across invocations, it is often convenient to use a property of the function itself.\n\nFor example, suppose you want to write a function that returns a unique integer whenever it is invoked. The function must never return the same value twice. In order to manage this, the function needs to keep track of the values it has already returned, and this information must persist across function invocations.\n\n    uniqueInteger.counter = 0;\n\n    function uniqueInteger() {\n\n    return uniqueInteger.counter++;\n\n    }\n\n    uniqueInteger()\n\n0\n\n    uniqueInteger()\n\n1\n\nCompute factorials and cache results as properties of the function itself.\n\n    function factorial(n) {\n\n    if (Number.isInteger(n) &#x26;&#x26; n > 0) {\n\n    if (!(n in factorial)) {\n\n    factorial[n] = n * factorial(n-1);\n\n    }\n\n    return factorial[n];\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n    return NaN;\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    factorial[1] = 1;\n\nInitialize the cache to hold this base case.\n\n    factorial(6)\n\n720\n\n    factorial[5]\n\n120; the call above caches this value\n\n### Functions as Namespaces\n\nVariables declared within a function are not visible outside of the function. For this reason, it is sometimes useful to define a function simply to act as a temporary namespace in which you can define variables without cluttering the global namespace.\n\nVariables that would have been global become local to the function. Following code defines only a single global variable: the function name `chunkNamespace`.\n\n    function chunkNamespace() {\n\n    // Chunk of code goes here\n\n    // Any variables defined in the chunk are local to this function\n\n    // instead of cluttering up the global namespace.\n\n    }\n\n    chunkNamespace();\n\nIf defining even a single property is too much, you can define and invoke an anonymous function in a single expression — IIEF (immediately invoked function expression)\n\n    (function() {\n\n    // chunkNamespace() function rewritten as an unnamed expression.\n\n    // Chunk of code goes here\n\n    }());\n\n### Closures\n\nJavaScript uses lexical scoping. This means that functions are executed using the variable scope that was in effect when they were defined, not the variable scope that is in effect when they are invoked.\n\nIn order to implement lexical scoping, the internal state of a JavaScript function object must include not only the code of the function but also a reference to the scope in which the function definition appears.\n\nThis combination of a function object and a scope (a set of variable bindings) in which the function's variables are resolved is called a closure.\n\nClosures become interesting when they are invoked from a different scope than the one they were defined in. This happens most commonly when a nested function object is returned from the function within which it was defined.\n\n    let scope = \"global scope\";\n\n    function checkscope() {\n\n    let scope = \"local scope\";\n\n    function f() { return scope; }\n\n    return f();\n\n    }\n\n`checkscope()`\n\n\"local scope\"\n\n    let scope = \"global scope\";\n\n    function checkscope() {\n\n    let scope = \"local scope\";\n\n    function f() { return scope; }\n\n    return f;\n\n    }\n\n`let s = checkscope()();`\n\n\"local scope\"\n\nClosures capture the local variables of a single function invocation and can use those variables as private state.\n\n    let uniqueInteger = (function() {\n\n    let counter = 0;\n\n    return function() { return counter++; };\n\n    }());\n\n`uniqueInteger()`\n\n0\n\n`uniqueInteger()`\n\n1\n\nit is the return value of the function that is being assigned to `uniqueInteger`.\n\nPrivate variables like counter need not be exclusive to a single closure: it is perfectly possible for two or more nested functions to be defined within the same outer function and share the same scope.\n\n    function counter() {\n\n    let n = 0;\n\n    return {\n\n    count: function() { return n++; },\n\n    reset: function() { n = 0; }\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n`let c = counter(), d = counter();`\n\n`c.count()`\n\n0\n\n`d.count()`\n\n0\n\n`c.reset();`\n\n`c.count()`\n\n0\n\n`d.count()`\n\n1\n\nYou can combine this closure technique with property getters and setters\n\n    function counter(n) {\n\n    return {\n\n    get count() { return n++; },\n\n    set count(m) {\n\n    if (m > n) n = m;\n\n    else throw Error(\"count can only be set to a larger value\")\n\n    }\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n`let c = counter(1000);`\n\n`c.count`\n\n1000\n\n`c.count`\n\n1001\n\n`c.count = 2000;`\n\n`c.count`\n\n2000\n\n`c.count = 2000;`\n\nError: count can only be set to a larger value\n\nDefine a private variable and two nested functions to get and set the value of that variable.\n\n    function addPrivateProperty(o, name, predicate) {\n\n    let value;\n\n    o[`get${name}`] = function() { return value; };\n\n    o[`set${name}`] = function(v) {\n\n    if (predicate &#x26;&#x26; !predicate(v)) {\n\n    throw new TypeError(`set${name}: invalid value ${v}`);\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n    value = v;\n\n    }\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n`let o = {};`\n\n`addPrivateProperty(o, \"Name\", x => typeof x === \"string\");`\n\n`o.setName(\"Frank\");`\n\n`o.getName()`\n\n\"Frank\"\n\n`o.setName(0);`\n\nTypeError: try to set a value ofthe wrong type\n\n### Function Properties, Methods, and Constructor\n\nSince functions are objects, they can have properties and methods, just like any other object.\n\n### The length Property\n\nThe read-only length property of a function specifies the arity of the function — the number of parameters it declares in its parameter list, which is usually the number of arguments that the function expects.\n\n### The name Property\n\nThis property is primarily useful when writing debugging or error messages.\n\n### The prototype Property\n\nWhen a function is used as a constructor, the newly created object inherits properties from the prototype object.\n\n### The call() and apply() Methods\n\n`call()` and `apply()` allow you to indirectly invoke a function as if it were a method of some other object. The first argument to both `call()` and `apply()` is the object on which the function is to be invoked; this argument is the invocation context and becomes the value of the `this` keyword within the body of the function.\n\nTo invoke the function`f()` as a method of the object o (passing no arguments),\n\n`f.call(o);`\n\n`f.apply(o);`\n\nTo pass two numbers to the function `f()` and invoke it as if it were a method of the object o,\n\n    f.call(o, 1, 2);\n\nThe `apply()` method is like the `call()` method, except that the arguments to be passed to the function are specified as an array:\n\n    f.apply(o, [1,2]);\n\nThe `trace()`function defined uses the `apply()`method instead of a spread operator, and by doing that, it is able to invoke the wrapped method with the same arguments and the same this value as the wrapper method\n\n    function trace(o, m) {\n\n    let original = o[m];\n\n    o[m] = function(...args) {\n\n    console.log(new Date(), \"Entering:\", m);\n\n    let result = original.apply(this, args);\n\n    console.log(new Date(), \"Exiting:\", m);\n\n    return result;\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n### The bind() Method\n\nThe primary purpose of `bind()` is to bind a function to an object.\n\n`function f(y) { return this.x + y; }`\n\n`let o = { x: 1 };`\n\n`let g = f.bind(o);`\n\n`g(2)`\n\n3\n\n`let p = { x: 10, g };`\n\n`p.g(2)`\n\n3 // g is still bound to o, not p.\n\nThe most common use case for calling `bind()` is to make non-arrow functions behave like arrow functions.\n\nPartial application is a common technique in functional programming and is sometimes called `currying`.\n\n`let sum = (x,y) => x + y;`\n\n`let succ = sum.bind(null, 1);`\n\n`succ(2)`\n\n3\n\n### The toString() Method\n\nMost (but not all) implementations of this `toString()` method return the complete source code for the function\n\n### The Function() Constructor\n\nThe Function() constructor is best thought of as a globally scoped version of `eval()` that defines new variables and functions in its own private scope. You will probably never need to use this constructor in your code.\n\n### Higher-Order Functions\n\nA higher-order function is a function that operates on functions, taking one or more functions as arguments and returning a new function.\n\n    function not(f) {\n\n    return function(...args) {\n\n    let result = f.apply(this, args);\n\n    return !result;\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n`const even = x => x % 2 === 0;`\n\nA function to determine if a number is even\n\n`const odd = not(even);`\n\n`[1,1,3,5,5].every(odd)`\n\ntrue\n\nReturns a new function that maps one array to another\n\n    const map = function(a, ...args) { return a.map(...args); };\n\n    function mapper(f) {\n\n    return a => map(a, f);\n\n    }\n\n    const increment = x => x + 1;\n\n    const incrementAll = mapper(increment);\n\n    incrementAll([1,2,3]\n\n\\[2,3,4\\]\n\nExample that takes two functions, f and g, and returns a new function that computes f(g()):\n\n    function compose(f, g) {\n\n    return function(...args) {\n\n    return f.call(this, g.apply(this, args));\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n`const sum = (x,y) => x+y;`\n\n`const square = x => x*x;`\n\n`compose(square, sum)(2,3)`\n\n25\n\n### Memoization\n\nWe defined a factorial function that cached its previously computed results. In functional programming, this kind of caching is called memoization.\n\n### Classes\n\nJavaScript's classes and prototype-based inheritance mechanism are substantially different from the classes and class-based inheritance mechanism of Java.\n\n### Classes and Prototypes\n\nIf we define a prototype object and then use `Object.create()` to create objects that inherit from it, we have defined a JavaScript class.\n\nFactory function that returns a new range object:\n\n    function range(from, to) {\n\n    let r = Object.create(range.methods);\n\n    r.from = from;\n\n    r.to = to;\n\n    return r;\n\n    }\n\n    range.methods = {\n\n    includes(x) { return this.from &#x3C;= x &#x26;&#x26; x &#x3C;= this.to; },\n\n    *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n\n    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x &#x3C;= this.to; x++)\n\n    yield x;\n\n    },\n\n    toString() { return \"(\" + this.from + \"...\" + this.to +\")\"; }\n\n    };\n\n`let r = range(1,3);`\n\n`r.includes(2)`\n\ntrue\n\n`r.toString()`\n\n\"(1…3)\"\n\n`[...r]`\n\n\\[1, 2, 3\\]\n\n### Classes and Constructors\n\nA constructor is a function designed for the initialization of newly created objects.\n\nThe critical feature of constructor invocations is that the `prototype` property of the constructor is used as the prototype of the new object.\n\nWhile almost all objects have a prototype, only a few objects have a `prototype` property. It is function objects that have a `prototype` property.\n\nThis means that all objects created with the same constructor function inherit from the same object and are therefore members of the same class.\n\nA Range class using a constructor\n\n    function Range(from, to) {\n\n    this.from = from;\n\n    this.to = to;\n\n    }\n\n    Range.prototype = {\n\n    includes: function(x) { return this.from &#x3C;= x &#x26;&#x26; x &#x3C;= this.to; },\n\n    [Symbol.iterator]: function*() {\n\n    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x &#x3C;= this.to; x++)\n\n    yield x;\n\n    },\n\n    toString: function() { return \"(\" + this.from + \"...\" + this.to + \")\"; }\n\n    };\n\n`let r = new Range(1,3);`\n\n`r.includes(2)`\n\ntrue\n\n`r.toString()`\n\n\"(1…3)\"\n\n`[...r]`\n\n\\[1, 2, 3\\]\n\nBecause the `Range()`constructor is invoked with `new`, it does not have to call `Object.create()` or take any action to create a new object.\n\nIn the first example, the prototype was `range.methods`. This was a convenient and descriptive name, but arbitrary. In the second example, the prototype is `Range.prototype`, and this name is mandatory.\n\nAn invocation of the `Range()` constructor automatically uses `Range.prototype` as the prototype of the `new Range` object.\n\n### Constructors, Class Identity, and instanceof\n\nTwo objects are instances of the same class if and only if they inherit from the same prototype object.\n\nThe `instanceof` operator is not checking whether `r` was actually initialized by the Range constructor. Instead, it is checking whether `r` inherits from `Range.prototype`.\n\n    function Strange() {}\n\n    Strange.prototype = Range.prototype;\n\n    new Strange() instanceof Range\n\ntrue\n\nIf you want to test the prototype chain of an object for a specific prototype and do not want to use the constructor function as an intermediary, you can use the `isPrototypeOf()` method\n\n    range.methods.isPrototypeOf(r);\n\n### The constructor Property\n\nEvery regular JavaScript function automatically has a `prototype` property. The value of this property is an object that has a single, non-enumerable `constructor` property.\n\nThe value of the `constructor` property is the function object\n\n    let F = function() {};\n\n    let p = F.prototype;\n\n    let c = p.constructor;\n\n    c === F\n\ntrue\n\n`let o = new F();`\n\n`o.constructor === F`\n\ntrue\n\nInstances of the Range class, as defined, do not have a constructor property. We can remedy this problem by explicitly adding a constructor to the prototype:\n\n    Range.prototype = {\n\n    constructor: Range\n\n    };\n\nAnother common technique that you are likely to see in older JavaScript code is to use the predefined prototype object with its constructor property and add methods to it one at a time with code like this:\n\n    Range.prototype.includes = function(x) {\n\n    return this.from &#x3C;= x &#x26;&#x26; x &#x3C;= this.to;\n\n    };\n\n    Range.prototype.toString = function() {\n\n    return \"(\" + this.from + \"...\" + this.to + \")\";\n\n    };\n\n### Classes with the class Keyword\n\n    class Range {\n\n    constructor(from, to) {\n\n    this.from = from;\n\n    this.to = to;\n\n    }\n\n    includes(x) { return this.from &#x3C;= x &#x26;&#x26; x &#x3C;= this.to; }\n\n    *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n\n    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x &#x3C;= this.to; x++)\n\n    yield x;\n\n    }\n\n    toString() { return `(${this.from}...${this.to})`; }\n\n    }\n\n`let r = new Range(1,3);`\n\n`r.includes(2)`\n\ntrue\n\n`r.toString()`\n\n(1…3)\n\n`[...r]`\n\n\\[1, 2, 3\\]\n\nAlthough class bodies are superficially similar to object literals, they are not the same thing. In particular, they do not support the definition of properties with name/value pairs.\n\nIf your class does not need to do any initialization, you can omit the constructor keyword and its body, and an empty constructor function will be implicitly created for you.\n\nIf you want to define a class that subclasses — or inherits from — another class, you can use the `extends` keyword with the class keyword:\n\n    class Span extends Range {\n\n    constructor(start, length) {\n\n    if (length >= 0) {\n\n    super(start, start + length);\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n    super(start + length, start);\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\nclass declarations have both statement and expression forms\n\n`let Square = class { constructor(x) { this.area = x * x; } };`\n\n`new Square(3).area`\n\n9\n\n### Static methods\n\nYou can define a `static` method within a class body by prefixing the method declaration with the `static` keyword. Static methods are defined as properties of the constructor function rather than properties of the prototype object.\n\n    static parse(s) {\n\n    let matches = s.match(/^\\((\\d+)\\.\\.\\.(\\d+)\\)$/);\n\n    if (!matches) {\n\n    throw new TypeError(`Cannot parse Range from \"${s}\".`)\n\n    }\n\n    return new Range(parseInt(matches[1]),\n\n    parseInt(matches[2]));\n\n    }\n\nThe method defined by this code is `Range.parse()`, not `Range.prototype.parse()`, and you must invoke it through the constructor, not through an instance:\n\n    let r = Range.parse('(1...10)');\n\n### Getters, Setters, and other Method Forms\n\nWithin a class body, you can define getter and setter methods just as you can in object literals. The only difference is that in class bodies, you don't put a comma after the getter or setter.\n\n### Public, Private, and Static Fields\n\nThe ES6 standard only allows the creation of methods (including getters, setters, and generators) and static methods; it does not include syntax for defining fields.\n\nIf you want to define a field on a class instance, you must do that in the constructor function or in one of the methods. And if you want to define a static field for a class, you must do that outside the class body, after the class has been defined.\n\nStandardization is underway, however, for extended class syntax that allows the definition of instance and static fields, in both public and private forms.\n\n    class Buffer {\n\n    constructor() {\n\n    this.size = 0;\n\n    this.capacity = 4096;\n\n    this.buffer = new Uint8Array(this.capacity);\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n←&#x26;gt;\n\n    class Buffer {\n\n    size = 0;\n\n    capacity = 4096;\n\n    buffer = new Uint8Array(this.capacity);\n\n    }\n\nThe same proposal that seeks to standardize these instance fields also defines private (with the \\# prefix) instance fields.\n\n    class Buffer {\n\n    #size = 0;\n\n    get size() { return this.#size; }\n\n    }\n\nA related proposal seeks to standardize the use of the `static` keyword for fields.\n\n    static integerRangePattern = /^\\((\\d+)\\.\\.\\.(\\d+)\\)$/;\n\n    static parse(s) {\n\n    let matches = s.match(Range.integerRangePattern);\n\n    if (!matches) {\n\n    throw new TypeError(`Cannot parse Range from \"${s}\".`)\n\n    }\n\n    return new Range(parseInt(matches[1]), matches[2]);\n\n    }\n\n### Adding Methods to Existing Classes\n\nWe can augment JavaScript classes simply by adding new methods to their prototype objects.\n\n    if (!String.prototype.startsWith) {\n\n    String.prototype.startsWith = function(s) {\n\n    return this.indexOf(s) === 0;\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n    Number.prototype.times = function(f, context) {\n\n    let n = this.valueOf();\n\n    for(let i = 0; i &#x3C; n; i++) f.call(context, i);\n\n    };\n\n### Subclasses\n\n### Subclasses and Prototypes\n\nSpan subclass of the Range class. This subclass will work just like a Range, but instead of initializing it with a start and an end, we'll instead specify a start and a distance, or span.\n\n    function Span(start, span) {\n\n    if (span >= 0) {\n\n    this.from = start;\n\n    this.to = start + span;\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n    this.to = start;\n\n    this.from = start + span;\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\nEnsure that the `Span` prototype inherits from the `Range`\n\n    Span.prototype = Object.create(Range.prototype);\n\nWe don't want to inherit `Range.prototype.constructor`, so we define our own constructor property:\n\n    Span.prototype.constructor = Span;\n\n`Span` overrides the `toString()` method\n\n`Span.prototype.toString = function() {`\n`` return `(${this.from}... +${this.to - this.from})`; ``\n`};`\n\nA robust subclassing mechanism needs to allow classes to invoke the methods and constructor of their superclass, but prior to ES6, JavaScript did not have a simple way to do these things.\n\n### Subclasses with extends and super\n\n    class EZArray extends Array {\n\n    get first() { return this[0]; }\n\n    get last() { return this[this.length-1]; }\n\n    }\n\n`let a = new EZArray();`\n\n`a instanceof EZArray`\n\ntrue\n\n`a instanceof Array`\n\ntrue\n\n`a.push(1,2,3,4);`\n\n`a.pop()`\n\n4\n\n`a.first`\n\n1\n\n`a.last`\n\n3\n\n`Array.isArray(a)`\n\ntrue\n\n`EZArray.isArray(a)`\n\ntrue\n\n`Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(EZArray.prototype`\n\ntrue\n\n`Array.isPrototypeOf(EZArray)`\n\ntrue\n\nExample demonstrates the use of the `super` keyword to invoke the constructor and methods of the superclass\n\n    class TypedMap extends Map {\n\n    constructor(keyType, valueType, entries) {\n\n    if (entries) {\n\n    for(let [k, v] of entries) {\n\n    if (typeof k !== keyType || typeof v !== valueType) {\n\n    throw new TypeError(`Wrong type for entry [${k}, ${v}]`);\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    super(entries);\n\n    this.keyType = keyType;\n\n    this.valueType = valueType;\n\n    }\n\n    set(key, value) {\n\n    if (this.keyType &#x26;&#x26; typeof key !== this.keyType) {\n\n    throw new TypeError(`${key} is not of type${this.keyType}`);\n\n    }\n\n    if (this.valueType &#x26;&#x26; typeof value !== this.valueType)\n\n    {\n\n    throw new TypeError(`${value} is not of type ${this.valueType}`);\n\n    }\n\n    return super.set(key, value);\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\nYou may not use the `this` keyword in your constructor until after you have invoked the superclass constructor with `super()`. This enforces a rule that superclasses get to initialize themselves before subclasses do.\n\nOnce private fields are supported, we could change these properties to `#keyType` and `#valueType` so that they could not be altered from the outside.\n\n### Class Hierarchies and Abstract Classes\n\nDefine abstract classes — classes that do not include a complete implementation — to serve as a common superclass for a group of related subclasses.\n\n### Modules\n\n### Automating Closure-Based Modularity\n\nImagine a tool that takes a set of files, wraps the content of each of those files within an immediately invoked function expression, keeps track of the return value of each function, and concatenates everything into one big file.\n\n    const modules = {};\n\n    function require(moduleName) { return modules[moduleName]; }\n\n    modules[\"sets.js\"] = (function() {\n\n    const exports = {};\n\n    exports.BitSet = class BitSet { ... };\n\n    return exports;\n\n    }());\n\n    modules[\"stats.js\"] = (function() {\n\n    const exports = {};\n\n    const sum = (x, y) => x + y;\n\n    const square = x = > x * x;\n\n    exports.mean = function(data) { ... };\n\n    exports.stddev = function(data) { ... };\n\n    return exports;\n\n    }());\n\nwriting code like the following to make use of those modules\n\n    const stats = require(\"stats.js\");\n\n    const BitSet = require(\"sets.js\").BitSet;\n\n    // Now write code using those modules\n\n    let s = new BitSet(100);\n\n    s.insert(10);\n\n    s.insert(20);\n\n    s.insert(30);\n\n    let average = stats.mean([...s]);\n\n### Modules in ES6\n\nES6 adds import and export keywords to JavaScript and finally supports real modularity as a core language feature.\n\nES6 modularity is conceptually the same as Node modularity: each file is its own module, and constants, variables, functions, and classes defined within a file are private to that module unless they are explicitly exported.\n\n### ES6 Exports\n\nTo export a constant, variable, function, or class from an ES6 module, simply add the keyword export before the declaration\n\n    export const PI = Math.PI;\n\n    export function degreesToRadians(d) { return d * PI / 180; }\n\n    export class Circle {\n\n    constructor(r) { this.r = r; }\n\n    area() { return PI * this.r * this.r; }\n\n    }\n\nor:\n\n    export { Circle, degreesToRadians, PI };\n\nIt is common to write modules that export only one value (typically a function or class), and in this case, we usually use export `default` instead of `export`\n\n    export default class BitSet {\n\n    // implementation omitted\n\n    }\n\n### ES6 Imports\n\n    import BitSet from './bitset.js';\n\n    import { mean, stddev } from \"./stats.js\";\n\nWhen importing from a module that defines many exports, however, you can easily import everything with an import statement like this:\n\n    import * as stats from \"./stats.js\";\n\nWith the wildcard import shown in the previous example, the importing module would use the imported `mean()` and`stddev()` functions through the stats object, invoking them as `stats.mean()` and `stats.stddev()`.\n\nNote: not finished.\n\n### The JavaScript Standard Library\n\n### The Set Class\n\nSets are not ordered or indexed, and they do not allow duplicates.\n\n    let s = new Set();\n\n    let t = new Set([1, s]);\n\n    let t = new Set(s);\n\n    let unique = new Set(\"Mississippi\");\n\nThe argument to the `Set()` constructor need not be an array: any iterable object (including other Set objects) is allowed.\n\nThe `add()` method takes a single argument; if you pass an array, it adds the array itself to the set, not the individual array elements. `add()` always returns the set it is invoked on, however, so if you want to add multiple values to a set, you can used chained method calls like.\n\nit is very important to understand that set membership is based on strict equality checks, like the === operator performs.\n\nThe most important thing we do with sets is not to add and remove elements from them, but to check to see whether a specified value is a member of the set:\n\n`let oneDigitPrimes = new Set([2,3,5,7]);`\n\n`oneDigitPrimes.has(2)`\n\nThe Set class is iterable, which means that you can use a `for/of` loop to enumerate all of the elements of a set:\n\n    let sum = 0;\n\n    for(let p of oneDigitPrimes) {\n\n    sum += p; // and add them up\n\n    }\n\nBecause Set objects are iterable, you can convert them to arrays and argument lists with the … spread operator\n\n`[...oneDigitPrimes]`\n\nJavaScript Set class always remembers the order that elements were inserted in, and it always uses this order when you iterate a set: the first element inserted will be the first one iterated (assuming you haven't deleted it first), and the most recently inserted element will be the last one iterated.\n\nSet class also implements a `forEach()` method\n\n    let product = 1;\n\n    oneDigitPrimes.forEach(n => { product *= n; });\n\n### The Map Class\n\n    let m = new Map();\n\n    let n = new Map([[\"one\", 1],[\"two\", 2]]);\n\n    let copy = new Map(n);\n\n    let o = { x: 1, y: 2};\n\n    let p = new Map(Object.entries(o));\n\nmap is a set of keys, each of which has an associated value. This is not quite the same as a set of key/value pairs.\n\nuse `has()` to check whether a map includes the specified key; use `delete()` to remove a key (and its associated value) from the map; use `clear()` to remove all key/value pairs from the map; and use the size property to find out how many keys a map contains.\n\n`set()` method of Map can be chained.\n\nAny JavaScript value can be used as a key or a value in a Map. This includes`null, undefined`, and `NaN`, as well as reference types like objects and arrays.\n\nMap compares keys by identity, not by equality.\n\n`let m = new Map();`\n\n`m.set({}, 1);`\n\n`m.set({}, 2);`\n\nMap a different empty object to the number 2.\n\n`m.get({})`\n\nundefined:\n\n`m.set(m, undefined);`\n\n`m.has(m)`\n\ntrue\n\n`m.get(m)`\n\nundefined\n\nIterate over map:\n\n`let m = new Map([[\"x\", 1], [\"y\", 2]]);`\n\n`[...m]`\n\n\\[\\[\"x\", 1\\], \\[\"y\", 2\\]\\]\n\n`for(let [key, value] of m) {...}`\n\nMap class iterates in insertion order\n\nIf you want to iterate just the keys or just the associated values of a map, use the `keys()` and `values()` methods: these return iterable objects that iterate keys and values, in insertion order. (The\n`entries()` method returns an iterable object that iterates key/value pairs, but this is exactly the same as iterating the map directly.)\n\n    [...m.keys()]\n\n    [...m.values()]\n\n    [...m.entries()]\n\nMap objects can also be iterated using the `forEach()`\n\n    m.forEach((value, key) => {...}\n\nNote that the value parameter comes before the key parameter.\n\n### WeakMap and WeakSet\n\nThe `WeakMap`class is a variant (but not an actual subclass) of the Map class that does not prevent its key values from being garbage collected.\n\n`WeakMap`keys must be objects or arrays; primitive values are not subject to garbage collection and cannot be used as keys.\n\nWeakMap implements only the`get(), set(), has(),` and `delete()` methods. In particular, `WeakMap` is not iterable and does not define `keys(), values(),` or `forEach()`. If WeakMap was iterable, then its keys would be reachable and it wouldn't be weak.\n\nSimilarly, WeakMap does not implement the size property because the `size` of a WeakMap could change at any time as objects are garbage collected\n\n### Typed Arrays and Binary Data\n\nThey differ from regular arrays in some very important ways\n\n· The elements of a typed array are all numbers. Unlike regular JavaScript numbers, however, typed arrays allow you to specify the type (signed and unsigned integers and IEEE-754 floating point) and size (8 bits to 64 bits) of the numbers to be stored in the array.\n\n· You must specify the length of a typed array when you create it, and that length can never change.\n\n· The elements of a typed array are always initialized to 0 when the array is created.\n\n    Int8Array()\n\n    Uint8Array()\n\n    Uint8ClampedArray()\n\n    Int16Array()\n\n    Uint32Array()\n\n    Uint16Array()\n\n    Int32Array()\n\n    BigInt64Array()\n\n    BigUint64Array()\n\n    Float32Array()\n\n    let bytes = new Uint8Array(1024);\n\n    let matrix = new Float64Array(9);\n\n    let sudoku = new Int8Array(81);\n\nInitialize with values\n\n    let white = Uint8ClampedArray.of(255, 255, 255, 0);\n\n    let ints = Uint32Array.from(white);\n\none more way to create typed arrays that involves the `ArrayBuffer` type\n\n    let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(1024*1024);\n\n    buffer.byteLength\n\n1024\\*1024\n\nTyped arrays are not true arrays, but they re-implement most array methods, so you can use them pretty much just like you'd use regular arrays:\n\n`let ints = new Int16Array(10);`\n\n10 short integers\n\n`ints.fill(3).map(x=>x*x).join(\"\")`\n\n\"9999999999\"\n\nRemember that typed arrays have fixed lengths, so the length property is read-only, and methods that change the length of the array (such as`push(), pop(), unshift(), shift(),` and `splice()`) are not implemented for typed arrays. Methods that alter the contents of an array without changing the length (such as `sort(), reverse()`, and `fill()`) are implemented.\n\n### Determine Endianess and DataView\n\n    let littleEndian = new Int8Array(new Int32Array([1]).buffer)\n\n    [0] === 1;\n\nYou can use the `DataView` class, which defines methods for reading and writing values from an `ArrayBuffer` with explicitly specified byte ordering. Refer to book for more examples.\n\n### Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions\n\nRegExp objects may be created with the `RegExp()` constructor, of course, but they are more often created using a special literal syntax.\n\n    let pattern = /s$/;\n\n←&#x26;gt;\n\n    let pattern = new RegExp(\"s$\");\n\nRegular expressions can also have one or more flag characters that affect how they work\n\n    let pattern = /s$/i;\n\ni = case insensitive\n\nPunctuation characters have special meanings in regular expressions: `^ $ . * + ? = ! : | \\ / ( ) [ ] { }.`Other punctuation characters, such as quotation marks and @, do not have special meaning and simply match themselves literally in a regular expression.\n\nIf you use the `RegExp()` constructor, keep in mind that any backslashes in your regular expression need to be doubled, since strings also use backslashes as an escape character.\n\n**Character**\n\n**Matches**\n\n`[...]`\n\nAny one character between the brackets.\n\n`[^...]`\n\nAny one character not between the brackets\n\n`.`\n\nAny character except newline or another Unicode line terminator. Or, if the `RegExp` uses the s flag, then a period matches any character, including line terminators.\n\n`\\w`\n\nAny ASCII word character. Equivalent to \\[a-zA-Z0-9\\_\\].\n\n`\\W`\n\nEquivalent to \\[^a-zA-Z0-9\\_\\]\n\n`\\s`\n\nAny Unicode whitespace character.\n\n`\\S`\n\nAny character that is not Unicode whitespace.\n\n`\\d`\n\nEquivalent to \\[0-9\\].\n\n`\\D`\n\nEquivalent to \\[⁰-9\\].\n\n`[\\b]`\n\nA literal backspace (special case).\n\n`[\\s\\d]`\n\nAny one whitespace character or digit\n\nREPETITIONS\n\n**Character**\n\n**Meaning**\n\n`{n,m}`\n\nMatch the previous item at least n times but no more than m times\n\n`{n,}`\n\nMatch the previous item n or more times.\n\n`{n}`\n\nMatch exactly n occurrences of the previous item.\n\n`?`\n\nEquivalent to {0,1}.\n\n`+`\n\nEquivalent to {1,}\n\n\\*\n\nEquivalent to {0,}.\n\n**Example**\n\n**Description**\n\n    let r = /\\d{2,4}/;\n\nMatch between two and four digits\n\n    r = /\\w{3}\\d?/;\n\nMatch exactly three word characters and an optional digit\n\n    r = /\\s+java\\s+/;\n\nMatch \"java\" with one or more spaces before and after\n\n    r = /[^(]*/;\n\nMatch zero or more characters that are not open parens\n\nIf you want to match repetitions of more complicated expressions, you'll need to define a group with parentheses\n\nBe careful when using the \\* and ? repetition characters. Since these characters may match zero instances of whatever precedes them, they are allowed to match nothing.\n\n### NON-GREEDY REPETITION\n\nIt is also possible to specify that repetition should be done in a non-greedy way. Simply follow the repetition character or characters with a question mark: `??, +?, *?`, or even {1,5}?.\n\n**String**\n\n**Pattern**\n\n**Match**\n\n    \"aaa\"\n\n    /a+/\n\n    \"aaa\"\n\n    \"aaa\"\n\n    /a+?/\n\n    \"a\"\n\nNote that using non-greedy repetition may not always produce the results you expect. This is because regular expression pattern matching is done by findingthe first position in the string at which a match is possible. Since a match is possible starting at the first character of the string, shorter matches starting at subsequent characters are never even considered.\n\n### ALTERNATION, GROUPING, AND REFERENCES\n\n**Char**\n\n**Pattern**\n\n**Pattern**\n\n`|`\n\n`/ab|cd|ef/`\n\n\"ab\" or the string \"cd\" or the string \"ef\".\n\n`/\\d{3}|[a-z]{4}/`\n\neither three digits or four lowercase letters.\n\n`/a|ab/`\n\nmatches only the first letter \"a\"\n\n`()`\n\n`/java(script)?/`\n\nmatches \"java\" followed by the optional \"script\"\n\n`/(ab|cd)+|ef/`\n\nmatches \"java\" followed by the optional \"script\"\n\nIf the left alternative matches, the right alternative is ignored, even if it would have produced a \"better\" match\n\nAnother purpose of parentheses in regular expressions is to define subpatterns within the complete pattern. When a regular expression is successfully matched against a target string, it is possible to extract the portions of the target string that matched any particular parenthesized subpattern. For example, suppose you are looking for one or more lowercase letters followed by one or more digits. You might use the pattern `/[a-z]+\\d+/`. But suppose you only really care about the digits at the end of each match. If you put that part of the pattern in parentheses (/\\[a-z\\]+(\\\\d+)/), you can extract the digits from any matches you find,\n\nA related use of parenthesized subexpressions is to allow you to refer back to a subexpression later in the same regular expression. This is done by following a \\\\ character by a digit or digits. The digits refer to the position of the parenthesized subexpression within the regular expression. For example, \\\\1 refers back to the first subexpression, and \\\\3 refers to the third.\n\n**Match**\n\n**Pattern**\n\nzero or more characters within single or double quotes. However, it does not\nrequire the opening and closing quotes to match\n\n    /['\"][^'\"]*['\"]/\n\nTo require the quotes to match,use a reference\n\n    /(['\"])[^'\"]*\\1/\n\n**Character**\n\n**Meaning**\n\n|\n\nmatch either the subexpression to the left or the subexpression to the right.\n\n(…)\n\nGrouping: group items into a single unit that can be used with \\*, +, ?, |, and so on. Also remember the characters that match this group for use with later references\n\n(?:…)\n\ngroup items into a single unit, but do not remember the characters that match this group.\n\nNote`(?:...)` syntax:\n\nIn pattern`\"/([Jj]ava(?:[Ss]cript)?)\\sis\\s(fun\\w*)/`\" `\\2` refers to the text matched by `(fun\\w*)` since `(?:[Ss]cript)?)` in not remembered.\n\n### SPECIFYING MATCH POSITION\n\n_regular expression anchors_ because they anchor the pattern to a specific position in the search string. The most commonly used anchor elements are ^, which ties the pattern to the beginning of the string, and $, which anchors the pattern to the end of the string.\n\n**Example**\n\n**Pattern**\n\nmatch the word \"JavaScript\" on a line by itself\n\n`/^JavaScript$/`\n\nTo search for \"Java\" as a word by itself you can try the pattern `/\\sJava\\s/`, which requires a space before and after the word. But there are two problems with this solution. First, it does not match \"Java\" at the beginning or the end of a string, but only if it appears with space on either side. Second, when this pattern does find a match, the matched string it returns has leading and trailing spaces, which is not quite what's needed. So instead of matching actual space characters with \\\\s, match (or anchor to) word boundaries with \\\\b. The resulting expression is `/\\bJava\\b/`.\n\nThe element `\\B` anchors the match to a location that is not a word boundary. Thus, the pattern `/\\B[Ss]cript/` matches \"JavaScript\" and \"postscript\", but not \"script\" or \"Scripting\".\n\nYou can also use arbitrary regular expressions as anchor conditions.\n\nIf you include an expression within `(?= and )` characters, it is a lookahead assertion, and it specifies that the enclosed characters must match, without actually matching them.\n\n**Example**\n\n**Pattern**\n\n**Matches**\n\nto match the name of a common programming language, but only if it is followed by a colon\n\n`/[Jj]ava([Ss]cript)?(?=\\:)/`\n\nmatches the word \"JavaScript\" in \"JavaScript: The DefinitiveGuide\"\n\ndoes not match \"Java\" in \"Java in a Nutshell\"\n\nIf you instead introduce an assertion with `(?!`, it is a negative lookahead assertion.\n\n### FLAGS\n\nFlags are specified after the second / character of a regular expression literal or as a string passed as the second argument to the RegExp() constructor.\n\n**Flag**\n\n**Meaning**\n\ng\n\n\"global\" — that is,that we intend to use it to find all matches within a string rather than just finding the first &#x3C;a href=\"http://match.it/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">match.it&#x3C;/a> does alter the behavior of the String `match()` method and the `RegExp exec()` method in important ways.\n\ni\n\ncase-insensitive\n\nm\n\n\"multiline\" mode\n\ns\n\nuseful when working with text that includes newlines.Normally, a \".\" in a regular expression matches any character except a line terminator. When the s flag is used, however, \".\" will match any character, including line terminators.\n\nu\n\nUnicode.\n\nSetting the u flag on a RegExp also allows you to use the new `\\u{...}` escape sequence for Unicode character and also enables the \\\\p{...} notation for Unicode character classes.\n\ny\n\n\"sticky\". should match at the beginning of a string or at the first character following the previous match\n\n### String Methods for Pattern Matching\n\n### SEARCH()\n\nStrings support four methods that use regular expressions.\n\n`\"JavaScript\".search(/script/ui)`\n\n4\n\n`\"Python\".search(/script/ui)`\n\n-1\n\n`search()` does not support global searches; it ignores the `g` flag of its regular expression argument.\n\nREPLACE()\n\n`text.replace(/javascript/gi, \"JavaScript\");`\n\nNo matter how it is capitalized, replace it with the correct capitalization\n\nparenthesized subexpressions of a regular expression are numbered from left to right and that the regular expression remembers the text that each subexpression matches.\n\nto replace quotation marks in a string with other characters:\n\n`let quote = /\"([^\"]*)\"/g;`\n\n`'He said \"stop\"'.replace(quote, '«$1»')`\n\n'He said «stop»'\n\nIf your RegExp uses named capture groups, then you can refer to the matching text by name rather than by number:\n\n`let quote = /\"(?&#x3C;quotedText>[^\"]*)\"/g;`\n\n`'He said \"stop\"'.replace(quote, '«$&#x3C;quotedText>»')`\n\n'He said «stop»'\n\nInstead of passing a replacement string as the second argument to replace(), you can also pass a function that will be invoked to compute the replacement value.\n\nExample to convert decimal integers in a string to hexadecimal:\n\n`let s = \"15 times 15 is 225\";`\n\n`s.replace(/\\d+/gu, n => parseInt(n).toString(16))`\n\n\"f times f is e1\"\n\n### MATCH()\n\n`\"7 plus 8 equals 15\".match(/\\d+/g)`\n\n\\[\"7\", \"8\", \"15\"\\]\n\nIf the regular expression does not have the `g` flag set, `match()` does not do a global search; it simply searches for the first match. In this nonglobal case, `match()` still returns an array, but the array elements are completely different.\n\nThus, if `match()` returns an array a, a\\[0\\] contains the complete match, a\\[1\\] contains the substring that matched the first parenthesized expression, and so on.\n\n    let url = /(\\w+):\\/\\/([\\w.]+)\\/(\\S*)/;\n\n    let text = \"Visit my blog at http://www.example.com/~david\";\n\n    let match = text.match(url);\n\n    let fullurl, protocol, host, path;\n\n    if (match !== null) {\n\n    fullurl = match[0];\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"http://www.example.com/~david\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"&#x3C;http://www.example.com/~david>&#x3C;/a>\"\n\n    protocol = match[1];\n\n\"http\"\n\n    host = match[2];\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"http://www.example.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"www.example.com&#x3C;/a>\"\n\n    path = match[3];\n\n\"~david\"\n\nIn this non-global case, the array returned by match() also has some object properties in addition to the numbered array elements.\n\ninput property refers to the string on which match() was called\n\nThe index property is the position within that string at which the match starts.\n\nif the regular expression contains named capture groups, then the returned array also has a groups property whose value is an object.\n\n`let url = /(?&#x3C;protocol>\\w+):\\/\\/(?&#x3C;host>[\\w.]+)\\/(?&#x3C;path>\\S*)/;`\n\n`let text = \"Visit my blog at http://www.example.com/~david\";`\n\n`let match = text.match(url);`\n\n`match[0]`\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"http://www.example.com/~david\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"&#x3C;http://www.example.com/~david>&#x3C;/a>\"\n\n`match.input`\n\ntext\n\n`match.index`\n\n17\n\n`match.groups.protocol`\n\n\"http\"\n\n`match.groups.host`\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"http://www.example.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"www.example.com&#x3C;/a>\"\n\n`match.groups.path`\n\n\"~david\"\n\nThere are also important but less dramatic differences in behavior when the y flag is set. Refer to book for examples.\n\n### MATCHALL()\n\nInstead of returning an array of matching substrings like `match()` does, however, it returns an iterator that yields the kind of match objects that match() returns when used with a non-global RegExp.\n\n### SPLIT()\n\n`\"123,456,789\".split(\",\")`\n\n\\[\"123\", \"456\",\"789\"\\]\n\n`\"1, 2, 3,\\n4, 5\".split(/\\s*,\\s*/)`\n\n\\[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\",\"5\"\\]\n\nSurprisingly, if you call `split()` with a RegExp delimiter and the regular expression includes capturing groups, then the text that matches the capturing groups will be included in the returned array.\n\n`const htmlTag = /&#x3C;([^>]+)>/;`\n\n`\"Testing&#x3C;br/>1,2,3\".split(htmlTag)`\n\n\\[\"Testing\", \"br/\",\"1,2,3\"\\]\n\n### The RegExp Class\n\nThe `RegExp()` constructor is useful when a regular expression is being dynamically created and thus cannot be represented with the regular expression literal syntax.\n\n    let zipcode = new RegExp(\"\\\\d{5}\", \"g\");\n\n`let exactMatch = /JavaScript/;`\n`let caseInsensitive = new RegExp(exactMatch, \"i\");`\n\n### TEST()\n\nReturns true or false by calling `exec()`.\n\n### EXEC()\n\n    let pattern = /Java/g;\n\n    let text = \"JavaScript > Java\";\n\n    let match;\n\n    while((match = pattern.exec(text)) !== null) {\n\n    console.log(`Matched ${match[0]} at ${match.index}`);\n\n    console.log(`Next search begins at ${pattern.lastIndex}`);\n\n    }\n\n### THE LASTINDEX PROPERTY AND REGEXP REUSE\n\nThe use of the `lastIndex` property with the g and y flags is a particularly awkward part of this API. When you use these flags, you need to be particularly careful when calling the `match(), exec()`, or `test()` methods because the behavior of these methods depends on `lastIndex`, and the value of `lastIndex` depends on what you have previously done with the RegExp object.\n\nTo find the index of all &#x26;lt;p&#x26;gt; tags within a string of HTML text:\n\n    let match, positions = [];\n\n    while((match = /&#x3C;p>/g.exec(html)) !== null) {\n\n    positions.push(match.index);\n\n    }\n\nIf the html string contains at least one &#x26;lt;p&#x26;gt; tag, then it will loop forever. For each iteration of the loop, we're creating a new RegExp object with `lastIndex` set to 0, so `exec()` always begins at the start of the string, and if there is a match, it will keep matching over and over. The solution, of course, is to define the RegExp once, and save it to a variable so that we're using the same RegExp object for each iteration of the loop.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes reusing a RegExp object is the wrong thing to do. Suppose, for example, that we want to loop through all of the words in a dictionary to find words that contain pairs of double letters.\n\n    let dictionary = [ \"apple\", \"book\", \"coffee\" ];\n\n    let doubleLetterWords = [];\n\n    let doubleLetter = /(\\w)\\1/g;\n\n    for(let word of dictionary) {\n\n    if (doubleLetter.test(word)) {\n\n    doubleLetterWords.push(word);\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n`doubleLetterWords`\n\n\\[\"apple\", \"coffee\"\\]: \"book\" is missing!\n\nBecause we set the g flag on the RegExp, the `lastIndex` property is changed after successful matches, and the `test()` method (which is based on `exec()`) starts searching for a match at the position specified by `lastIndex`. After matching the \"pp\" in \"apple\", `lastIndex` is 3, and so we start searching the word \"book\" at position 3 and do not see the \"oo\" that it contains.\n\n### Dates and Times\n\n    let now = new Date();\n\nThe current time\n\n    let epoch = new Date(0);\n\nMidnight, January 1st, 1970, GMT\n\n    let century = new Date(2100,\n\n    0,\n\n    1,\n\n    2, 3, 4, 5);\n\nYear 2100\n\nJanuary\n\n1st\n\n02:03:04.005, local\n\n    let century = new Date(Date.UTC(2100, 0, 1));\n\nMidnight in GMT, January 1, 2100\n\nIf you print a date (with console.log(century), for example), it will, by default, be printed in your local time zone. If you want to display a date in UTC, you should explicitly convert it to a string with `toUTCString()` or`toISOString()`.\n\nif you pass a string to the Date() constructor, it will attempt to parse that string as a date and time specification\n\n`let century = new Date(\"2100-01-01T00:00:00Z\");`\n\nOnce you have a Date object, various get and set methods allow you to query and modify the year, month, day-of-month, hour, minute, second, and millisecond fields of the Date. Each of these methods hastwo forms: one that gets or sets using local time and one that gets or sets using UTC time.\n\nNote that the methods for querying the day-of-month are `getDate()` and `getUTCDate()`. The more natural-sounding functions `getDay()` and `getUTCDay()` return the day-of-week (0 for Sunday through 6 for Saturday). The day-of-week is read-only, so there is not a corresponding `setDay()` method.\n\n### Timestamps\n\nJavaScript represents dates internally as integers that specify the number of milliseconds since (or before) midnight on January 1, 1970, UTC time.\n\nFor any Date object, the `getTime()` method returns this internal value, and the `setTime()` method sets it.\n\n    d.setTime(d.getTime() + 30000);\n\nadd 30 secs\n\nThe static Date.now() method returns the current time as a timestamp and is helpful when you want to measure how long your code takes to run\n\n    let startTime = Date.now();\n\n    reticulateSplines(); // Do some time-consuming operation\n\n    let endTime = Date.now();\n\n    console.log(`Spline reticulation took ${endTime -startTime}ms.`);\n\nadds three months and two weeks to the current date:\n\n`let d = new Date();`\n`d.setMonth(d.getMonth() + 3, d.getDate() + 14);`\n\n### Formatting and Parsing Date Strings\n\n    let d = new Date(2020, 0, 1, 17, 10, 30);\n\n    d.toString()\n\n\"Wed Jan 01 2020 17:10:30 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)\"\n\n    d.toUTCString()\n\n\"Thu, 02 Jan 2020 01:10:30 GMT\"\n\n    d.toLocaleDateString()\n\n\"1/1/2020\": 'en-US' locale\n\n    d.toLocaleTimeString()\n\n\"5:10:30 PM\": 'en-US' locale\n\n    d.toISOString()\n\n\"2020-01-02T01:10:30.000Z\"\n\nthere is also a static Date.parse() method that takes a string as its argument, attempts to parse it as a date and time, and returns a timestamp representing that date. `Date.parse()` is able to parse the same strings that the `Date()` constructor can and is guaranteed to be able to parse the output of`toISOString(), toUTCString()`, and`toString()`.\n\n### Error Classes\n\nOne good reason to use an Error object is that, when you create an Error, it captures the state of the JavaScript stack, and if the exception is uncaught, the stack trace will be displayed with the error message, which will help you debug the issue.\n\nError objects have two properties: `message` and `name`, and a`toString()` method. Node and all modern browsers also define a `stack` property on Error objects.\n\nSubclasses are `EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError,` and `URIError`.\n\nYou should feel free to define your own Error subclasses that best encapsulate the error conditions of your own program.\n\n    class HTTPError extends Error {\n\n    constructor(status, statusText, url) {\n\n    super(`${status} ${statusText}: ${url}`);\n\n    this.status = status;\n\n    this.statusText = statusText;\n\n    this.url = url;\n\n    }\n\n    get name() { return \"HTTPError\"; }\n\n    }\n\n    let error = new HTTPError(404, \"Not Found\", \"http://example.com/\");\n\n    error.status\n\n404\n\n    error.message\n\n\"404 Not Found:&#x3C;a href=\"&#x3C;&#x3C;http://example.com/>>\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">http://example.com/&#x3C;/a>\"\n\n    error.name\n\nHTTPError\n\n### JSON Serialization and Parsing\n\nJavaScript supports JSON serialization and deserialization with the two functions `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse().`\n\n    let o = {s: \"\", n: 0, a: [true, false, null]};\n\n    let s = JSON.stringify(o);\n\ns == '{\"s\":\"\",\"n\":0,\"a\":\\[true,false,null\\]}'\n\n    let copy = JSON.parse(s);\n\ncopy == {s: \"\", n: 0, a:\\[true, false, null\\]}\n\nInefficient way of creating a deep copy of an object\n\n    function deepcopy(o) {\n\n    return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o));\n\n    }\n\nTypically, you pass only a single argument to `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`. Both functions accept an optional second argument that allows us to extend the JSON format.\n\n`JSON.stringify()` also takes an optional third argument. If you would like your JSONformatted string to be human-readable (if it is being used as a configuration file, for example), then you should pass null as the second argument and pass a number or string as the third argument. If the third argument is a number, then it will use that number of spaces for each indentation level. If the third argument is a string of whitespace (such as '\\\\t'), it will use that string for each level of indent.\n\n### JSON Customizations\n\nIf `JSON.stringify()` is asked to serialize a value that is not natively supported by the JSON format, it looks to see if that value has a `toJSON()` method, and if so, it calls that method and then stringifies the return value in place of the original value. Date objects implement `toJSON()`: it returns the same string that `toISOString()` method does.\n\nIf you need to re-create Date objects (or modify the parsed object inany other way), you can pass a \"reviver\" function as the second argument to `JSON.parse()`.\n\n    let data = JSON.parse(text, function(key, value) {\n\n    if (key[0] === \"_\") return undefined;\n\n    if (typeof value === \"string\" &#x26;&#x26; /^\\d\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d-\\d\\dT\\d\\d:\\d\\d:\\d\\d.\\d\\d\\dZ$/.test(value)) {\n\n    return new Date(value);\n\n    }\n\n    return value;\n\n    });\n\n### The Console API\n\nConsole functions that print their arguments like console.log() have a little-known feature: if the first argument is a string that includes `%s, %i, %d, %f, %o, %O, or %c`, then this first argument is treated as format string, and the values of subsequent arguments are substituted into the string in place of the two-character % sequences.\n\n### URL API\n\n    let url = new URL(\"https://example.com:8000/path/name?q=term#fragment\");\n\n    url.href\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"https://example.com:8000/path/name\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"&#x3C;https://example.com:8000/path/name>&#x3C;/a>?q=term\\#fragment\"\n\n    url.origin\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"https://example.com:8000/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"&#x3C;https://example.com:8000>&#x3C;/a>\"\n\n    url.protocol\n\n\"https:\"\n\n    url.host\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"http://example.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"example.com&#x3C;/a>:8000\"\n\n    url.hostname\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"http://example.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"example.com&#x3C;/a>\"\n\n    url.port\n\n\"8000\"\n\n    url.pathname\n\n\"/path/name\"\n\n    url.search\n\n\"?q=term\"\n\n    url.hash\n\n\"\\#fragment\"\n\n    let url = new URL(\"https://example.com\");\n\n    url.pathname = \"api/search\";\n\nAdd a path to an API endpoint\n\n    url.search = \"q=test\";\n\nAdd a query parameter\n\n    url.toString()\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"https://example.com/api/search?q=test\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"&#x3C;https://example.com/api/search?q=test>&#x3C;/a>\"\n\nOne of the important features of the URL class is that it correctly adds punctuation and escapes special characters in URLs when that is needed\n\n    let url = new URL(\"https://example.com\");\n\n    url.pathname = \"path with spaces\";\n\n    url.pathname\n\n\"/path%20with%20spaces\"\n\n    url.search = \"q=foo#bar\";\n\n    url.search\n\n\"?q=foo%23bar\"\n\n    url.href\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"https://example.com/path%20with%20spaces?q=foo%23bar\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"&#x3C;https://example.com/path%20with%20spaces?q=foo%23bar>&#x3C;/a>\"\n\nOften, however, HTTP requests encode the values of multiple form fields or multiple API parameters into the query portion of a URL. In this format, the query portion of the URL is a question mark followed by one or more name/value pairs, which are separated from one another by ampersands.\n\nIf you want to encode these kinds of name/value pairs into the query portion of a URL, then the searchParams property will be more useful than the search property.\n\n`let url = new URL(\"https://example.com/search\");`\n\n`url.search`\n\n\"\"\n\n`url.searchParams.append(\"q\", \"term\");`\n\n`url.search`\n\n\"?q=term\"\n\n`url.searchParams.set(\"q\", \"x\");`\n\n`url.search`\n\n\"?q=x\"\n\n`url.searchParams.append(\"opts\", \"1\");`\n\n`url.search`\n\n\"?q=x&#x26;opts=1\"\n\nThe value of the searchParams property is a URLSearchParams object.\n\n`let url = new URL(\"http://example.com\");`\n\n`let params = new URLSearchParams();`\n\n`params.append(\"q\", \"term\");`\n\n`params.append(\"opts\", \"exact\");`\n\n`params.toString()`\n\n\"q=term&#x26;opts=exact\"\n\n`url.search = params;`\n\n`url.href`\n\n&#x3C;a href=\"http://example.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">\"&#x3C;http://example.com/>&#x3C;/a>?q=term&#x26;opts=exact\"\n\n### Timers\n\n`setTimeout()` and`setInterval()`—that allow programs to ask the browser to invoke a function after a specified amount of time has elapsed or to invoke the function repeatedly at a specified interval.\n\n    setTimeout(() => { console.log(\"Ready...\"); }, 1000);\n\n    setTimeout(() => { console.log(\"set...\"); }, 2000);\n\n    setTimeout(() => { console.log(\"go!\"); }, 3000);\n\nIf you want to invoke a function repeatedly, use `setInterval()`\n\nBoth `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` return a value. If you save this value in a variable, you can then use it later to cancel the execution of the function by passing it to `clearTimeout()` or `clearInterval()`.\n\n    let clock = setInterval(() => {\n\n    console.clear();\n\n    console.log(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n\n    }, 1000);\n\n    setTimeout(() => { clearInterval(clock); }, 10000);\n\nAfter 10 seconds: stop the repeating code above\n\n### Iterators and Generators\n\nThe iterator method of an iterable object does not have a conventional name but uses the Symbol, Symbol.iterator as its name. So a simple for/of loop over an iterable object iterable could also be written the hard way, like this:\n\n    let iterable = [99];\n\n    let iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();\n\n    for(let result = iterator.next(); !result.done; result =iterator.next()) {\n\n    console.log(result.value) // result.value == 99\n\n    }\n\nWhen you want to iterate though a \"partially used\" iterator:\n\n`let list = [1,2,3,4,5];`\n`let iter = list[Symbol.iterator]();`\n\n`let head = iter.next().value;`\n\nhead == 1\n\n`let tail = [...iter];`\n\ntail == \\[2,3,4,5\\]\n\n### Implementing Iterable Objects\n\nwe will implement the Range class one more time, making it iterable without relying on a generator.\n\nIn order to make a class iterable, you must implement a method whose name is the Symbol `Symbol.iterator`\n\n    class Range {\n\n    constructor (from, to) {\n\n    this.from = from;\n\n    this.to = to;\n\n    }\n\n    has(x) { return typeof x === \"number\" &#x26;&#x26; this.from &#x3C;= x &#x26;&#x26; x &#x3C;= this.to; }\n\n    toString() { return `{ x | ${this.from} ≤ x ≤ ${this.to}}`; }\n\n    [Symbol.iterator]() {\n\n    let next = Math.ceil(this.from);\n\n    let last = this.to;\n\n    return {\n\n    next() {\n\n    return (next &#x3C;= last) ? { value: next++ } : { done: true };\n\n    },\n\n    [Symbol.iterator]() { return this; }\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    for(let x of new Range(1,10)) console.log(x);\n\nLogs numbers 1 to 10\n\n    [...new Range(-2,2)]\n\n\\[-2, -1, 0,1, 2\\]\n\nIn addition to making your classes iterable, it can be quite useful to define functions that return iterable values.\n\nReturn an iterable object that iterates the result of applying `f()` to each value from the source iterable\n\n    function map(iterable, f) {\n\n    let iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();\n\n    return {\n\n    [Symbol.iterator]() { return this; },\n\n    next() {\n\n    let v = iterator.next();\n\n    if (v.done) {\n\n    return v;\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n    return { value: f(v.value) };\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n`[...map(new Range(1,4), x => x*x)]`\n\n\\[1, 4, 9, 16\\]\n\nReturn an iterable object that filters the specified iterable, iterating only those elements for which the predicate returns true\n\n    function filter(iterable, predicate) {\n\n    let iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();\n\n    return {\n\n    [Symbol.iterator]() { return this; },\n\n    next() {\n\n    for(;;) {\n\n    let v = iterator.next();\n\n    if (v.done || predicate(v.value)) {\n\n    return v;\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n`[...filter(new Range(1,10), x => x % 2 === 0)]`\n\n\\[2,4,6,8,10\\]\n\n### Generators\n\nParticularly useful when the values to be iterated are not the elements of a data structure, but the result of a computation.\n\nTo create a generator, you must first define a generator function — defined with the keyword `function*` rather than `function`\n\nWhen you invoke a generator function, it does not actually execute the function body, but instead returns a generator object. This generator object is an iterator.\n\nCalling its `next()` method causes the body of the generator function to run from the start (or whatever its current position is) until it reaches a `yield` statement.\n\nThe value of the `yield` statement becomes the value returned by the `next()` call on the iterator.\n\n    function* oneDigitPrimes() {\n\n    yield 2;\n\n    yield 3;\n\n    yield 5;\n\n    yield 7;\n\n    }\n\n    let primes = oneDigitPrimes();\n\nwe get a generator\n\n    primes.next().value\n\n2\n\n    primes.next().value\n\n3\n\n    primes.next().value\n\n5\n\n    primes.next().value\n\n7\n\n    primes.next().done\n\ntrue\n\nGenerators have a `Symbol.iterator` method to make them iterable\n\n`primes[Symbol.iterator]()`\n\n`[...oneDigitPrimes()]`\n\n\\[2,3,5,7\\]\n\n    let sum = 0;\n\n    for(let prime of oneDigitPrimes()) sum += prime;\n\n    sum\n\n17\n\nLike regular functions, however, we can also define generators in expression form.\n\n    const seq = function*(from,to) {\n\n    for(let i = from; i &#x3C;= to; i++) yield i;\n\n    };\n\n    [...seq(3,5)]\n\n\\[3, 4, 5\\]\n\nIn classes and object literals, we can use shorthand notation to omit the function keyword entirely when we define methods.\n\n    let o = {\n\n    x: 1, y: 2, z: 3,\n\n    *g() {\n\n    for(let key of Object.keys(this)) {\n\n    yield key;\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    };\n\n`[...o.g()]`\n\n\\[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"g\"\\]\n\nGenerators often make it particularly easy to define iterable classes.\n\n    *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n\n    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x &#x3C;= this.to; x++)\n\n    yield x;\n\n    }\n\n### Generator Examples\n\nGenerators are more interesting if they actually generate the values they yield by doing some kind of computation.\n\ngenerator function that yields Fibonacci numbers\n\n    function* fibonacciSequence() {\n\n    let x = 0, y = 1;\n\n    for(;;) {\n\n    yield y;\n\n    [x, y] = [y, x+y];\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\nIf this generator is used with the … spread operator, it will loop until memory is exhausted and the program crashes.\n\nUse it in a `for/of` loop, however\n\n    function fibonacci(n) {\n\n    for(let f of fibonacciSequence()) {\n\n    if (n-- &#x3C;= 0) return f;\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    fibonacci(20)\n\n10946\n\nThis kind of infinite generator becomes more useful with a `take()` generator like this\n\n    function* take(n, iterable) {\n\n    let it = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();\n\n    while(n-- > 0) {\n\n    let next = it.next();\n\n    if (next.done) return;\n\n    else yield next.value;\n\n    }\n\n    }\n\n    [...take(5, fibonacciSequence())]\n\n\\[1, 1, 2, 3, 5\\]\n\n### Asynchronous Javascript\n\n`Promises`, new in ES6, are objects that represent the not-yet-available result of an asynchronous operation.\n\nThe keywords `async` and `await` were introduced in ES2017 and provide new syntax that simplifies asynchronous programming by allowing you to structure your Promise based code as if it was synchronous.\n\nAsynchronous iterators and the`for/await` loop were introduced in ES2018 and allow you to work with streams of asynchronous events using simple loops that appear synchronous.\n\n### Asynchronous Programming with Callbacks\n\n### Timers\n\n`setTimeout(checkForUpdates, 60000);`\n\n    let updateIntervalId = setInterval(checkForUpdates, 60000);\n\n    function stopCheckingForUpdates() {\n\n    clearInterval(updateIntervalId);\n\n    }\n\n### Events\n\nEvent-driven JavaScript programs register callback functions for specified types of events in specified contexts, and the web browser invokes those functions whenever the specified events occur.\n\nThese callback functions are called event handlers or event listeners, and they are registered with `addEventListener()`\n\nAsk the web browser to return an object representing the HTML &#x26;lt;button&#x26;gt; element that matches this CSS selector:\n\n`let okay = document.querySelector('#confirmUpdateDialogbutton.okay');`\n\nNow register a callback function to be invoked when the user clicks on that button\n\n`okay.addEventListener('click', applyUpdate);`\n\n### Network Events\n\nJavaScript running in the browser can fetch data from a web server with code like this:\n\n    function getCurrentVersionNumber(versionCallback) {\n\n    let request = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n    request.open(\"GET\", \"http://www.example.com/api/version\");\n\n    request.send();\n\n    request.onload = function() {\n\n    if (request.status === 200) {\n\n    let currentVersion = parseFloat(request.responseText);\n\n    versionCallback(null, currentVersion);\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n    versionCallback(response.statusText, null);\n\n    }\n\n    };\n\n    request.onerror = request.ontimeout = function(e) {\n\n    versionCallback(e.type, null);\n\n    };\n\n    }\n\n### Promises\n\nPromises, a core language feature designed to simplify asynchronous programming.\n\nA Promise is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous computation. That result may or may not be ready yet, and the Promise API is intentionally vague about this: there is no way to synchronously get the value of a Promise; you can only ask the Promise to call a callback function when the value is ready.\n\nOne real problem with callback-based asynchronous programming is that it is common to end up with callbacks inside callbacks inside callbacks, with lines of code so highly indented that it is difficult to read.\n\nPromises allow this kind of nested callback to be re-expressed as a more linear Promise chain that tends to be easier to read and easier to reason about.\n\nAnother problem with callbacks is that they can make handling errors difficult. If an asynchronous function (or an asynchronously invoked callback) throws an exception, there is no way for that exception to propagate back to the initiator of the asynchronous operation. This is a fundamental fact about asynchronous programming: it breaks exception handling. Promises help here by standardizing a way to handle errors and providing a way for errors to propagate correctly through a chain of promises.\n\nNote that Promises represent the future results of single asynchronous computations. They cannot be used to represent repeated asynchronous computations, however.\n\nWe can't use Promises to replace `setInterval()` because that function invokes a callback function repeatedly, which is something that Promises are just not designed to do.\n\n### Using Promises\n\nHow we would use this Promise returning utility function\n\n    getJSON(url).then(jsonData => {\n\n    // callback function that will be asynchronously invoked with the parsed JSON value when it becomes available.\n\n    });\n\nThe Promise object defines a then() instance method. Instead of passing our callback function directly to `getJSON()`, we instead pass it to the then() method. When the HTTP response arrives, the body of that response is parsed as JSON, and the resulting parsed value is passed to the function that we passed to `then()`.\n\nIf you call the `then()` method of a Promise object multiple times, each of the functions you specify will be called when the promised computation is complete.\n\nUnlike many event listeners, though, a Promise represents a single computation, and each function registered with then() will be invoked only once.\n\n    function displayUserProfile(profile) { ...}\n\n    getJSON(\"/api/user/profile\").then(displayUserProfile);\n\n### HANDLING ERRORS WITH PROMISES\n\nAsynchronous operations, particularly those that involve networking, can typically fail in a number of ways, and robust code has to be written to handle the errors that will inevitably occur.\n\n`getJSON(\"/api/user/profile\").then(displayUserProfile, handleProfileError);`\n\nif `getJSON()` runs normally, it passes its result to `displayUserProfile()`. If there is an error (the user is not logged in, the server is down, the user's internet connection dropped, the request timed out, etc.), then `getJSON()` passes an Error object to `handleProfileError()`.\n\nIn practice, it is rare to see two functions passed to then(). There is a better and more idiomatic way of handling errors when working with Promises.\n\nTo understand it, first consider what happens if `getJSON()` completes normally but an error occurs in `displayUserProfile()`. That callback function is invoked asynchronously when `getJSON()` returns, so it is also asynchronous and cannot meaningfully throw an exception (because there is no code on the call stack to handle it).\n\n    getJSON(\"/api/user/profile\").then(displayUserProfile).catch(handleProfileError);\n\nWith this code, a normal result from`getJSON()` is still passed to `displayUserProfile()`, but any error in `getJSON()` or in `displayUserProfile()` (including any exceptions thrown by `displayUserProfile`) get passed to `handleProfileError()`.\n\n### Chaining Promises\n\nOne of the most important benefits of Promises is that they provide a natural way to express a sequence of asynchronous operations as a linear chain of `then()` method invocations, without having to nest each operation within the callback of the previous one.\n\n    fetch(documentURL)\n\n    .then(response => response.json())\n\n    .then(document => {return render(document); })\n\n    .then(rendered => {cacheInDatabase(rendered); })\n\n    .catch(error => handle(error));\n\nhas largely been replaced by the newer, Promise-based Fetch API. In its simplest form, this new HTTP API is just the function fetch(). That promise is fulfilled when the HTTP response begins to arrive and the HTTP status and headers are available.\n\n    fetch(\"/api/user/profile\")\n\n    .then(response => {\n\n    if (response.ok &#x26;&#x26;  response.headers.get(\"Content-Type\") === \"application/json\") {\n\n    // What can we do here? We don't actually have the response body yet.\n\n    }\n\n    });\n\nBut although the initial Promise is fulfilled, the body of the response may not yet have arrived. So these `text()` and`json()` methods for accessing the body of the response themselves return Promises.\n\n    fetch(\"/api/user/profile\")\n\n    .then(response => {\n\n    return response.json();\n\n    })\n\n    .then(profile => {\n\n    displayUserProfile(profile);\n\n    });\n\nThere is a second `then()` in the chain, which means that the first invocation of the `then()` method must itself return a Promise. That is not how Promises work, however.\n\nWhen we write a chain of `.then()` invocations, we are not registering multiple callbacks on a single Promise object. Instead, each invocation of the `then()` method returns a new Promise object. That new Promise object is not fulfilled until the function passed to `then()` is complete.\n\n    fetch(theURL)       // task 1; returns promise 1\n\n    .then(callback1)  // task 2; returns promise 2\n\n    .then(callback2); // task 3; returns promise 3\n\n### Resolving Promises\n\nThere is actually a fourth Promise object involved as which brings up the point of what it means for a Promise to be \"resolved.\"\n\nfetch() returns a Promise object which, when fulfilled, passes a Response object to the callback function we register. This Response object has `.text(), .json(),` and other methods to request the body of the HTTP response in various forms. But since the body may not yet have arrived, these methods must return Promise objects.\n\n\"task 2\" calls the `.json()` method and returns its value. This is the fourth Promise object, and it is the return value of the `callback1()` function.\n\nLet's consider:\n\n    function c1(response) {\n\n    let p4 = response.json();\n\n    return p4;\n\n    }\n\n    // callback 1\n\n    // returns promise 4\n\n    function c2(profile) {\n\n    displayUserProfile(profile);\n\n    }\n\n    // callback 2\n\n    let p1 = fetch(\"/api/user/profile\");\n\n    promise 1, task 1\n\n    let p2 = p1.then(c1);\n\n    promise 2, task 2\n\n    let p3 = p2.then(c2);\n\n    promise 3, task 3\n\nIn order for Promise chains to work usefully, the output of task 2 must become the input to task 3. The input to task 3 is the body of the URL that was fetched, parsed as a JSON object. But the return value of callback c1 is not a JSON object, but Promise p4 for that JSON object.\n\nWhen p1 is fulfilled, c1 is invoked, and task 2 begins. And when p2 is fulfilled, c2 is invoked, and task 3 begins.\n\nAnd when p2 is fulfilled, c2 is invoked, and task 3 begins. But just because task 2 begins when c1 is invoked,it does not mean that task 2 must end when c1 returns.\n\nPromises are about managing asynchronous tasks, and if task 2 is asynchronous, then that task will not be complete by the time the callback returns.\n\nWhen you pass a callback c to the `then()` method, `then()` returns a Promise p and arranges to asynchronously invoke c at some later time. The callback performs some computation and returns a value v. When the callback returns, p is resolved with the value v. When a Promise is resolved with a value that is not itself a Promise, it is immediately fulfilled with that value.\n\nSo if c returns a non-Promise, that return value becomes the value of p, p is fulfilled and we are done. But if the return value v is itself a Promise, then p is resolved but not yet fulfilled.\n\nAt this stage, p cannot settle until the Promise v settles. If v is fulfilled, then p will be fulfilled to the same value. If v is rejected, then p will be rejected for the same reason. This is what the \"resolved\" state of a Promise means\n\nthe Promise has become associated with, or \"locked onto,\" another Promise. We don't know yet whether p will be fulfilled or rejected, but our callback c no longer has any control over that. p is \"resolved\" in the sense that its fate now depends entirely on what happens to Promise v.\n\nLet's bring this back to our URL-fetching example. When c1 returns p4, p2 is resolved. But being resolved is not the same as being fulfilled, so task 3 does not begin yet. When the full body of the HTTP response becomes available, then the .`json()` method can parse it and use that parsed value to fulfill p4. When p4 is fulfilled, p2 is automatically fulfilled as well, with the same parsed JSON value. At this point, the parsed JSON object is passed to c2, and task 3 begins.\n\n### More on Promises and Errors\n\nWith synchronous code, if you leave out error-handling code, you'll at least get an exception and a stack trace that you can use to figure out what is going wrong. With asynchronous code, unhandled exceptions will often go unreported, and errors can occur silently, making them much harder to debug. The good news is that the `.catch()` method makes it easy to handle errors when working with Promises.\n\nTHE CATCH AND FINALLY METHODS\n\nThe `.catch()` method of a Promise is simply a shorthand way to call `.then()` with null as the first argument and an error-handling callback as the second argument.\n\nNormal exceptions don't work with asynchronous code. The `.catch()` method of Promises is an alternative that does work for asynchronous code.\n\n    fetch(\"/api/user/profile\")\n\n    .then(response => {\n\n    if (!response.ok) {\n\n    return null;\n\n    }\n\n    let type = response.headers.get(\"content-type\");\n\n    if (type !== \"application/json\") {\n\n    throw new TypeError(`Expected JSON, got ${type}`);\n\n    }\n\n    return response.json();\n\n    })\n\n    .then(profile => {\n\n    if (profile) {\n\n    displayUserProfile(profile);\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n    displayLoggedOutProfilePage();\n\n    }\n\n    })\n\n    .catch(e => {\n\n    if (e instanceof NetworkError) {\n\n    displayErrorMessage(\"Check your internet connection.\");\n\n    }\n\n    else if (e instanceof TypeError) {\n\n    displayErrorMessage(\"Something is wrong with our server!\");\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n    console.error(e);\n\n    }\n\n    });\n\np1 is the Promise returned by the `fetch()` call\n\np2 is the Promise returned by the first `.then()` call\n\nc1 is the callback that we pass to that .`then()` call\n\np3 is the Promise returned by the second `.then()` call\n\nc2 is the callback we pass to that call\n\nc3 is the callback that we pass to the `.catch()` call\n\nThe first thing that could fail is the fetch() request itself. Let's say p1 was rejected with a NetworkError object.\n\nWe didn't pass an error-handling callback function as the second argument to the `.then()` call, so p2 rejects as well with the same NetworkError object.\n\nWithout a handler, though, p2 is rejected, and then p3 is rejected for the same reason.\n\nAt this point, the c3 error-handling callback is called, and the NetworkError-specific code within it runs.\n\nThere are a couple of things worth noting about this code. First, notice that the error object thrown with a regular, synchronous throw statement ends up being handled asynchronously with a `.catch()` method invocation in a Promise chain. This should make it clear why this shorthand method is preferred over passing a second argument to .`then()`, and also why it is so idiomatic to end Promise chains with a `.catch()` call.\n\nit is also perfectly valid to use `.catch()` elsewhere in a Promise chain. If one of the stages in your Promise chain can fail with an error, and if the error is some kind of recoverable error that should not stop the rest of the chain from running, then you can insert a `.catch()` call in the chain, resulting in code that might look like this:\n\n    startAsyncOperation()\n\n    .then(doStageTwo)\n\n    .catch(recoverFromStageTwoError)\n\n    .then(doStageThree)\n\n    .then(doStageFour)\n\n    .catch(logStageThreeAndFourErrors);\n\nIf the callback returns normally, then the `.catch()` callback will be skipped, and the return value of the previous callback will become the input to the next .`then()` callback.\n\nOnce an error has been passed to a `.catch()` callback, it stops propagating down the Promise chain. A `.catch()` callback can throw a new error, but if it returns normally, than that return value is used to resolve and/or fulfill the associated Promise, and\nthe error stops propagating.\n\nSometimes, in complex network environments, errors can occur more or less at random, and it can be appropriate to handle those errors by simply retrying the asynchronous request.\n\n    queryDatabase()\n\n    .catch(e => wait(500).then(queryDatabase))\n\n    .then(displayTable)\n\n    .catch(displayDatabaseError);\n\n### Promises in Parallel\n\nSometimes,we want to execute a number of asynchronous operations in parallel. The function `Promise.all()` can do this. `Promise.all()` takes an array of Promise objects as its input and returns a Promise.\n\nThe returned Promise will be rejected if any of the input Promises are rejected. Otherwise, it will be fulfilled with an array of the fulfillment values of each of the input Promises.\n\n    const urls = [ /* zero or more URLs here */ ];\n\n    promises = urls.map(url => fetch(url).then(r => r.text()));\n\n    Promise.all(promises)\n\n    .then(bodies => { /* do something with the array of strings */ })\n\n    .catch(e => console.error(e));\n\nThe Promise returned by `Promise.all()` rejects when any of the input Promises is rejected. This happens immediately upon the first rejection and can happen while other input Promises are still pending. In ES2020, `Promise.allSettled()` takes an array of input\nPromises and returns a Promise, just like Promise.all() does. But `Promise.allSettled()` never rejects the returned Promise, and it does not fulfill that Promise until all of the input Promises have settled. The Promise resolves to an array of objects, with one object for each input Promise. Each of these returned objects has a status property set to \"fulfilled\" or \"rejected.\" If the status is \"fulfilled\", then the object will also have a value property that gives the fulfillment value. And if the status is \"rejected\", then the object will also have a reason property that gives the error or rejection value of the corresponding Promise.\n\n    Promise.allSettled([Promise.resolve(1), Promise.reject(2),3]).then(results => {\n\n    results[0] // => { status: \"fulfilled\", value: 1 }\n\n    results[1] // => { status: \"rejected\", reason: 2 }\n\n    results[2] // => { status: \"fulfilled\", value: 3 }\n\n    });\n\nOccasionally, you may want to run a number of Promises at once but may only care about the value of the first one to fulfill. In that case, you can use `Promise.race()` instead of `Promise.all()`. It returns a Promise that is fulfilled or rejected when the first of the Promises in the input array is fulfilled or rejected.\n\n### Making Promises\n\n### Promises in Sequence\n\n### async and await\n\nThese new keywords dramatically simplify the use of Promises and allow us to write Promise-based, asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code that blocks while waiting for network responses or other asynchronous events.\n\nAsynchronous code can't return a value or throw an exception the way that regular synchronous code can. And this is why Promises are designed the way the are. The value of a fulfilled Promise is like the return value of a synchronous function. And the value of a rejected Promise is like a value thrown by a synchronous function.\n\n`async` and `await` take efficient, Promise-based code and hide the Promises so that your asynchronous code can be as easy to read and as easy to reason about as inefficient, blocking, synchronous code.\n\nGiven a Promise object p, the expression await p waits until p settles. If p fulfills, then the value of await p is the fulfillment value of p. On the other hand, if p is rejected, then the await p expression throws the rejection value of p.\n\n    let response = await fetch(\"/api/user/profile\");\n\n    let profile = await response.json();\n\nIt is critical to understand right away that the `await` keyword does not cause your program to block and literally do nothing until the specified Promise settles. The code remains asynchronous, and the `await` simply disguises this fact. This means that any code that uses await is itself asynchronous.\n\n### async Functions\n\nBecause any code that uses await is asynchronous, there is one critical rule: you can only use the await keyword within functions that have been declared with the `async` keyword.\n\n    async function getHighScore() {\n\n    let response = await fetch(\"/api/user/profile\");\n\n    let profile = await response.json();\n\n    return profile.highScore;\n\n    }\n\nDeclaring a function `async` means that the return value of the function will be a Promise even if no Promise-related code appears in the body of the function.\n\nThe `getHighScore()` function is declared `async`, so it returns a Promise. And because it returns a Promise, we can use the `await` keyword with it:\n\n    displayHighScore(await getHighScore());\n\n### Awaiting Multiple Promises\n\nSuppose that we've written our `getJSON()` function using async:\n\n    async function getJSON(url) {\n\n    let response = await fetch(url);\n\n    let body = await response.json();\n\n    return body;\n\n    }\n\nAnd now suppose that we want to fetch two JSON values with this function\n\n    let value1 = await getJSON(url1);\n\n    let value2 = await getJSON(url2);\n\nThe problem with this code is that it is unnecessarily sequential: the fetch of the second URL will not begin until the first fetch is complete. If the second URL does not depend on the value obtained from the firstURL, then we should probably try to fetch the two values at the same time.\n\n    let [value1, value2] = await Promise.all([getJSON(url1), getJSON(url2)]);\n\n### The for/await Loop\n\nSuppose you have an array of URLs:\n\n    const urls = [url1, url2, url3];\n\nYou can call fetch() on each URL to get an array of Promises:\n\n    const promises = urls.map(url => fetch(url));\n\nWe could now use`Promise.all()` to wait for all the Promises in the array to be fulfilled. But suppose we want the results of the first fetch as soon as they become available and don't want to wait for all the URLs to be fetched.\n\n    for(const promise of promises) {\n\n    response = await promise;\n\n    handle(response);\n\n    }\n\n←&#x26;gt;\n\n    for await (const response of promises) {\n\n    handle(response);\n\n    }\n\nboth examples will only work if they are within functions declared async; a `for/await` loop is no different than a regular await expression in that way\n</code></pre>"}
