You can use it with any static site generator to create faster, more flexible web projects. Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.</p>\n<p>At its core, Netlify CMS is an open-source React app that acts as a wrapper for the Git workflow, using the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket API. This provides many advantages, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fast, web-based UI:</strong> With rich-text editing, real-time preview, and drag-and-drop media uploads.</li>\n<li><strong>Platform agnostic:</strong> Works with most static site generators.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy installation:</strong> Add two files to your site and hook up the backend by including those files in your build process or linking to our Content Delivery Network (CDN).</li>\n<li><strong>Modern authentication:</strong> Using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and JSON web tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible content types:</strong> Specify an unlimited number of content types with custom fields.</li>\n<li><strong>Fully extensible:</strong> Create custom-styled previews, UI widgets, and editor plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/#netlify-cms-vs-netlify\"></a>Netlify CMS vs. Netlify</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify.com</a> is a platform you can use to automatically build, deploy, serve, and manage your frontend sites and web apps. It also provides a variety of other features like form processing, serverless functions, and split testing. Not all Netlify sites use Netlify CMS, and not all sites using Netlify CMS are on Netlify.</p>\n<p>The folks at Netlify created Netlify CMS to fill a gap in the static site generation pipeline. There were some great proprietary headless CMS options, but no real contenders that were open source and extensibleâ€”that could turn into a community-built ecosystem like WordPress or Drupal. For that reason, Netlify CMS is <em>made</em> to be community-driven, and has never been locked to the Netlify platform (despite the name).</p>\n<p>With this in mind, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Netlify CMS without Netlify and deploy your site where you always have, hooking up your own CI, site hosting, CDN, etc.</li>\n<li>Use Netlify without Netlify CMS and edit your static site in your code editor.</li>\n<li>Or, use them together and have a fully-working CMS-enabled site with <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/\">one click</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you hook up Netlify CMS to your website, you're basically adding a tool for content editors to make commits to your site repository without touching code or learning Git.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/#find-out-more\"></a>Find out more</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Get a feel for the UI in the <a href=\"https://cms-demo.netlify.com/\">demo site</a>.
